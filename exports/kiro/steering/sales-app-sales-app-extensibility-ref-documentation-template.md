# Extension Documentation Template

Generate `docs/<ExtensionName>.md` inside the Sales App package. Create the `docs/` folder if it does not exist.

The document must contain these 9 sections:

1. **Extension name** — title matching the component name.
2. **Overview** — one-paragraph summary of what the extension does and why it was built.
3. **Extension point** — which extension point it registers on (e.g., `cart.cart-list.after`) and why that point was chosen.
4. **Hooks used** — list each hook (`useCart`, `usePDP`, etc.) with a brief explanation of what data it provides to this extension.
5. **Component structure** — description of the component tree, props, and state management.
6. **Styling** — CSS file name and summary of key classes.
7. **API integration** (if applicable) — endpoint, auth strategy (IO Proxy or direct), request/response shape.
   - **Source documentation:** URL or file path of the original API documentation, if provided.
   - **Generated types:** list of TypeScript interfaces generated from the API documentation.
   - Note which fields are optional (`?`) vs required per the documentation.
8. **How to test** — dev server command and URL to reach the extension.
9. **Known constraints** — any guards, edge cases, or limitations (e.g., `useCartItem().item` may be undefined).
