This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when building vtex io admin-facing react interfaces under the admin builder. covers vtex styleguide and shoreline usage, admin page composition, data-heavy admin interactions, and keeping administrative interfaces consistent with the vtex admin environment. use for settings pages, moderation tools, dashboards, or operational uis inside vtex admin.

# Admin React Interfaces

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when building administrative React interfaces for VTEX Admin experiences.

- Settings pages
- Moderation tools
- Internal dashboards
- Operational forms and tables

Do not use this skill for:
- storefront components
- render-runtime blocks
- route authorization design
- backend service structure

## Decision rules

- Use VTEX official design systems for admin interfaces.
- Prefer `vtex.styleguide` as the default choice for VTEX IO admin apps published to customers.
- Accept `@vtex/shoreline` as an official VTEX design system, especially in internal back-office contexts.
- Prefer core Styleguide layout patterns such as `Layout`, `PageHeader`, and `PageBlock` for page composition.
- Prefer Styleguide building blocks for common admin needs: `Table`, `Input`, `Dropdown`, `Toggle`, `Tabs`, `Modal`, `Spinner`, and `Alert`.
- Keep admin screens focused on operational clarity rather than storefront styling concerns.
- Prefer explicit loading, empty, and error states for data-heavy admin pages.
- Use button loading states and toast-based feedback for async actions so users can tell when a mutation starts, succeeds, or fails.
- Prefer internationalized messages over hardcoded admin copy so labels and feedback can stay consistent across stores and locales.
- Use tables, forms, filters, and feedback patterns that align with VTEX Admin conventions.
- Prefer official design system components over custom clickable `div` or `span` patterns so focus behavior, keyboard navigation, and accessibility attributes remain correct by default.
- For large lists and tables, prefer pagination and server-side filtering over loading everything into the browser and filtering in memory.
- For search and filtering, prefer the search and filter patterns offered by the official design systems instead of inventing custom control behavior.
- Keep labels, messages, and action copy in a single language per app and avoid mixing tones or languages on the same screen.
- In forms, keep actions consistent: use a primary save action, an optional secondary cancel action when appropriate, and explicit feedback after submit.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Admin UIs must use VTEX design systems

Admin panel components MUST use VTEX official design systems.

**Why this matters**

VTEX Admin has a consistent design language. VTEX official design systems preserve that consistency, while generic third-party UI libraries create inconsistent visuals, styling conflicts, and review problems.

**Detection**

If you see Material UI, Chakra, Ant Design, or another generic third-party UI system in an admin app, STOP and replace it with VTEX design system patterns. Do not flag `@vtex/shoreline` as third-party.

**Correct**

```tsx
import { Layout, PageHeader, PageBlock, Table } from 'vtex.styleguide'
```

```tsx
import { Button, Table, EmptyState } from '@vtex/shoreline'
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
import { DataGrid } from '@material-ui/data-grid'
```

### Constraint: Admin screens must expose loading, empty, and error states

Operational interfaces MUST make data state visible to the user.

**Why this matters**

Admin users need reliable operational feedback. Silent blank screens are harder to support and diagnose than explicit states.

**Detection**

If a page loads remote data but renders nothing meaningful on loading, empty, or error cases, STOP and add explicit UI states.

**Correct**

```tsx
if (loading) {
  return (
    <PageBlock>
      <Spinner />
    </PageBlock>
  )
}

if (error) {
  return (
    <PageBlock>
      <Alert type="error">Failed to load data. Please try again.</Alert>
    </PageBlock>
  )
}
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
return <Table items={data?.items ?? []} />
```

### Constraint: Admin actions must provide explicit user feedback

Mutations in admin screens MUST report success, failure, or pending state clearly.

**Why this matters**

Operational actions affect real store configuration and data. Users need immediate feedback to avoid repeated or ambiguous actions.

**Detection**

If a button triggers a write action with no feedback on result, STOP and add explicit feedback.

**Correct**

```tsx
<Button isLoading={saving}>Save</Button>
showToast({ message: 'Settings saved successfully' })
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
<Button onClick={save}>Save</Button>
```

### Constraint: Data-heavy admin screens must stay bounded and navigable

Lists, tables, and search-heavy admin screens MUST use bounded rendering patterns such as pagination and should prefer server-side filtering when the API supports it.

**Why this matters**

Admin pages often deal with operational datasets that grow over time. Rendering too many rows at once or filtering only in memory creates poor performance and brittle UX.

**Detection**

If a page renders very large collections without pagination, or loads the full dataset into the browser just to filter locally, STOP and add bounded navigation or server-side filtering.

**Correct**

```tsx
<Table items={items} />
<Pagination currentItemFrom={1} currentItemTo={10} totalItems={120} />
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
const filtered = allItems.filter(matchesSearch)
return <Table items={filtered} />
```

### Constraint: Interactive controls must use accessible semantics

Admin interactions MUST use accessible controls and should prefer official design system components instead of custom clickable non-semantic elements.

**Why this matters**

Keyboard navigation, focus handling, and screen-reader behavior are part of baseline admin usability. Non-semantic clickable elements make accessibility regressions much more likely.

**Detection**

If you see clickable `div` or `span` elements being used as primary controls where a button, link, or design system component should be used, STOP and replace them.

**Correct**

```tsx
<Button variation="primary">Save</Button>
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
<div onClick={save}>Save</div>
```

## Admin builder structure

Admin pages in VTEX IO are exposed through the Admin builder:

- Use the `admin/` folder to declare navigation and routes.
- Use `admin/navigation.json` to define sections, subsections, and Admin navigation paths.
- Use `admin/routes.json` to map each Admin path to a React component implemented under `react/`.
- Use the `react/` folder to implement the page components used by Admin routes.

Practical rules:

- Each entry in `admin/routes.json` should point to a real component in `react/`.
- The route `path` should stay aligned with the navigation structure declared in `admin/navigation.json`.
- Page components should use VTEX Admin layout patterns such as `Layout`, `PageHeader`, and `PageBlock`, or official Shoreline equivalents in internal contexts.

### Example: navigation.json structure

`admin/navigation.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "section": "storeSettings",
    "subSection": "storeFront",
    "subSectionItems": [
      {
        "labelId": "admin/my-settings.navigation.title",
        "path": "/admin/app/my-settings"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Main fields:

- `section` / `subSection`: define where the link appears in the Admin navigation tree.
- `subSectionItems[].path`: should match the `path` declared in `admin/routes.json`.
- `titleId` / `labelId`: message IDs used to internationalize navigation labels.
- `adminVersion`: optional and only needed for compatibility between legacy and newer Admin experiences. Do not use it in the default example for new apps.

### Example: tying Admin builder to a React page

`admin/routes.json`:

```json
{
  "admin.app.my-settings": {
    "component": "MySettingsPage",
    "path": "/admin/app/my-settings"
  }
}
```

`react/MySettingsPage.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { Layout, PageHeader, PageBlock } from 'vtex.styleguide'

const MySettingsPage: React.FC = () => (
  <Layout pageHeader={<PageHeader title="My settings" />}>
    <PageBlock>
      {/* Page content goes here */}
    </PageBlock>
  </Layout>
)

export default MySettingsPage
```

## Preferred pattern

Use VTEX design systems to keep operational state explicit and optimize for clarity over ornamental UI.
Use `PageHeader` and `PageBlock` with Styleguide where appropriate, or equivalent official Shoreline patterns in internal contexts. Use `Spinner`/`Alert`/`EmptyState` for data states and `showToast` plus button loading states for async feedback.
Use paginated tables for large datasets, prefer server-side filtering when possible, and keep form actions consistent with primary save and optional cancel behavior.

## Common failure modes

- Using third-party UI libraries in admin apps.
- Omitting loading, empty, or error states.
- Triggering mutations without visible feedback.
- Rendering large tables without pagination or filtering everything only in memory.
- Building clickable controls with non-semantic elements instead of accessible buttons or links.
- Mixing languages or inconsistent copy style on the same admin screen.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Does the screen use VTEX official design systems (Styleguide or Shoreline), not generic UI libs?
- [ ] Does the page use `PageHeader` and `PageBlock` layout patterns where appropriate (or Shoreline equivalents)?
- [ ] Are loading, empty, and error states explicit?
- [ ] Are large tables or lists paginated and filtered in a scalable way?
- [ ] Are write actions safe and visible?
- [ ] Are interactive controls using accessible semantics instead of clickable non-semantic elements?
- [ ] Are labels and feedback messages internationalized instead of hardcoded?
- [ ] Is the app using one consistent language and tone for labels and actions?
- [ ] Does the UI look and behave like a VTEX Admin tool?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when defining or changing the contract of a vtex io app through manifest.json, builder declarations, dependencies, peerdependencies, billingoptions, and app identity. covers how the app declares capabilities and integration boundaries. use for scaffolding apps, splitting responsibilities across apps, or fixing contract-level link and publish issues.

# App Contract & Builder Boundaries

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when the main decision is about what a VTEX IO app is, what capabilities it declares, and which integration boundaries it publishes through `manifest.json`.

- Creating a new VTEX IO app and defining its initial contract
- Adding or removing builders to match app capabilities
- Choosing between `dependencies` and `peerDependencies`
- Deciding whether a capability belongs in the current app or should move to another app
- Troubleshooting link or publish failures caused by manifest-level contract issues

Do not use this skill for:
- service runtime behavior such as `service.json`, memory, workers, or route exposure
- HTTP handler implementation, middleware composition, or event processing
- GraphQL schema, resolver, or data-fetching implementation
- storefront, admin, or render-runtime frontend behavior
- policy modeling and security boundary enforcement

## Decision rules

- Treat `manifest.json` as the app contract. It declares identity, builders, dependencies, peer dependencies, and high-level capabilities that other apps or the platform rely on.
- Add a builder only when the app truly owns that capability. Builders are not placeholders for future work.
- Keep the contract narrow. If a manifest starts to represent unrelated concerns, split those concerns into separate apps instead of creating a catch-all app.
- Use `dependencies` only for apps that can be safely auto-installed as part of the current app contract. Use `peerDependencies` for apps that must already exist in the environment, remain externally managed, or declare `billingOptions`.
- Keep naming and versioning publishable: `vendor`, `name`, and `version` must form a stable identity that can be linked, published, and consumed safely.
- Keep `billingOptions` aligned with the commercial contract of the app. If the app has billing implications, declare them explicitly in the manifest rather than leaving pricing behavior implicit.
- Apps that declare `billingOptions` cannot be consumed through `dependencies`. If the current app requires a billable app, model that relationship with `peerDependencies` and require manual installation by the account or edition owner.
- Edition apps are compositions of app contracts, not exceptions to them. Keep each underlying app contract explicit, narrow, and semver-safe so composition stays predictable across host environments.
- `manifest.json` can also declare app-level permissions and configuration surfaces, but detailed policy modeling belongs in security-focused skills and detailed `settingsSchema` design belongs in app-settings skills.

This is not an exhaustive list of builders; see the official Builders docs for the full catalog.

Builder ownership reference:

| Builder | Own this builder when the app contract includes |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `node` | backend runtime capability owned by this app |
| `graphql` | GraphQL schema exposure owned by this app |
| `react` | React bundles owned by this app |
| `admin` | Admin UI surfaces owned by this app |
| `store` | Store Framework block registration owned by this app |
| `messages` | localized message bundles owned by this app |
| `pixel` | storefront pixel injection owned by this app |
| `masterdata` | Master Data schema assets owned by this app |

Contract boundary heuristic:
1. If the capability is shipped, versioned, and maintained with this app, declare its builder here.
2. If the capability is only consumed from another app, declare a dependency instead of duplicating the builder.
3. If the capability introduces a separate runtime, security model, or release cadence, consider splitting it into another app.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Every shipped capability must be declared in the manifest contract

If the app ships a processable VTEX IO capability, `manifest.json` MUST declare the corresponding builder. Do not rely on folder presence alone, and do not assume VTEX IO infers capabilities from the repository structure.
Symmetrically, do not declare builders for capabilities that are not actually shipped by this app.

**Why this matters**

VTEX IO compiles and links apps based on declared builders, not on intent. If the builder is missing, the platform ignores that capability and the app contract becomes misleading. The app may link partially while the expected feature is absent.

**Detection**

If you see a maintained `/node`, `/react`, `/graphql`, `/admin`, `/store`, `/messages`, `/pixel`, or `/masterdata` directory, STOP and verify that the matching builder exists in `manifest.json`. If the builder exists but the capability does not, STOP and remove the builder or move the capability back into scope.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "vendor": "acme",
  "name": "reviews-platform",
  "version": "0.4.0",
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x",
    "graphql": "1.x",
    "messages": "1.x"
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "vendor": "acme",
  "name": "reviews-platform",
  "version": "0.4.0",
  "builders": {
    "messages": "1.x"
  }
}
```

The app ships backend and GraphQL capabilities but declares only `messages`, so the runtime contract is incomplete and the platform ignores the missing builders.

### Constraint: App identity and versioning must stay publishable and semver-safe

The `vendor`, `name`, and `version` fields MUST identify a valid VTEX IO app contract. Use kebab-case for the app name, keep the vendor consistent with ownership, and use full semantic versioning.

**Why this matters**

Consumers, workspaces, and release flows rely on app identity stability. Invalid names or incomplete versions break linking and publishing, while identity drift creates unsafe upgrades and hard-to-debug dependency mismatches.

**Detection**

If you see uppercase characters, underscores, non-semver versions, or vendor/name changes mixed into unrelated work, STOP and validate whether the change is intentional and release-safe.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "vendor": "acme",
  "name": "order-status-dashboard",
  "version": "2.1.0"
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "vendor": "AcmeTeam",
  "name": "Order_Status_Dashboard",
  "version": "2.1"
}
```

This identity is not safely publishable because the name is not kebab-case and the version is not valid semver.

### Constraint: Dependencies and peerDependencies must express installation intent correctly

Use `dependencies` only for apps that this app should install as part of its contract and that can be auto-installed safely. Use `peerDependencies` for apps that must already be present in the environment, should remain externally managed, or declare `billingOptions`.

**Why this matters**

This is the core contract boundary between your app and the rest of the VTEX IO workspace. Misclassifying a relationship causes broken installations, hidden coupling, and environment-specific behavior that only appears after link or publish. In particular, builder-hub rejects dependencies on apps that declare `billingOptions`.

**Detection**

If the app requires another app to function in every environment, STOP and confirm whether it belongs in `dependencies` or `peerDependencies`. If the target app declares `billingOptions`, STOP and move it to `peerDependencies`. If the app only integrates with a platform capability, host app, edition-managed app, or paid app that the account is expected to manage manually, STOP and keep it out of `dependencies`.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.search-graphql": "0.x"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "vtex.store": "2.x",
    "vtex.paid-app-example": "1.x"
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.store": "2.x",
    "vtex.paid-app-example": "1.x"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {}
}
```

This contract hard-installs a host app that should usually be externally managed and also attempts to auto-install a billable app, which builder-hub rejects.

## Preferred pattern

Start by deciding the smallest useful contract for the app, then declare only the identity and builders required for that contract.

Recommended manifest for a focused service-plus-GraphQL app:

```json
{
  "vendor": "acme",
  "name": "reviews-platform",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "title": "Reviews Platform",
  "description": "VTEX IO app that owns review APIs and review GraphQL exposure",
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x",
    "graphql": "1.x",
    "messages": "1.x"
  },
  "billingOptions": {
    "type": "free"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.search-graphql": "0.x"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "vtex.store": "2.x"
  }
}
```

Recommended contract split:

```text
reviews-platform/
├── manifest.json        # identity, builders, dependencies, peerDependencies
├── node/                # backend capability owned by this app
├── graphql/             # GraphQL capability owned by this app
└── messages/            # app-owned translations

reviews-storefront/
├── manifest.json        # separate release surface for storefront concerns
├── react/
└── store/
```

Use this split when the backend/API contract and the storefront contract have different ownership, release cadence, or integration boundaries.

## Common failure modes

- Declaring builders for aspirational capabilities that the app does not yet own, which makes the contract broader than the real implementation.
- Using one large manifest to represent backend runtime, frontend rendering, settings, policies, and integration concerns that should be separated into multiple skills or apps.
- Putting host-level apps in `dependencies` when they should remain `peerDependencies`.
- Pinning exact dependency versions instead of major-version ranges such as `0.x`, `1.x`, or `3.x`.
- Treating `manifest.json` as a dumping ground for runtime or security details that belong in more specific skills.
- Modeling `settingsSchema` here instead of using this skill only to decide whether app-level configuration belongs in the contract at all.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Does the manifest describe only capabilities this app actually owns and ships?
- [ ] Does every shipped capability have a matching builder declaration?
- [ ] Is the app identity publishable: valid `vendor`, kebab-case `name`, and full semver `version`?
- [ ] If the app has billing behavior, is `billingOptions` explicit and aligned with the app contract?
- [ ] Are `dependencies` and `peerDependencies` separated by installation intent?
- [ ] Would splitting the contract into two apps reduce unrelated concerns or release coupling?
- [ ] Are runtime, route, GraphQL implementation, frontend, and security details kept out of this skill?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when defining, validating, or consuming vtex io app settings. covers settingsschema, app-level configuration boundaries, and how backend or frontend code should depend on settings safely. use for merchant-configurable behavior, settings forms, or reviewing whether settings belong in app configuration rather than hardcoded logic or custom data entities.

# App Settings & Configuration Boundaries

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when deciding or implementing how a VTEX IO app should expose configurable settings.

- Defining `settingsSchema`
- Adding merchant-configurable app behavior
- Reviewing whether configuration belongs in app settings or custom data
- Reading and validating settings in app code

Do not use this skill for:
- runtime infrastructure settings in `service.json`
- Master Data entity design
- policy declaration details
- route auth modeling

## Decision rules

- Use app settings for stable configuration that merchants or operators should be able to manage explicitly.
- Use `settingsSchema` for app-level configuration managed through VTEX Admin, and use `store/contentSchemas.json` for Store Framework block configuration that varies by page or block instance.
- If the value is global for the app or account, it usually belongs in `settingsSchema`. If it varies per page, block, or theme composition, it usually belongs in `contentSchemas.json`.
- Do not use app settings as a substitute for high-volume operational data storage.
- Use JSON Schema explicitly with `properties`, `required`, `default`, `enum`, `format`, and related constraints instead of a generic root `type: object` only.
- Use `settingsSchema.access: "public"` only for non-sensitive values that are intentionally safe to expose to frontend code through `publicSettingsForApp`.
- If `access` is omitted, do not assume frontend GraphQL consumers can read the settings. Public frontend access must be an explicit choice.
- Use app settings for API keys, tokens, and secrets instead of hardcoding them in the codebase.
- Never expose secrets from app settings directly in HTTP responses, GraphQL responses, HTML, or browser-side props.
- Never expose secrets from app settings in logs either.
- For sensitive fields such as API keys or passwords, keep them as `type: "string"` and consider marking them with `format: "password"`. Some platform consumers, such as Apps GraphQL when using `hidePasswords`, may use this metadata to mask values in responses. Do not rely on this as the only security layer: secrets must still be treated as backend-only and never exposed in responses or logs.
- UI-specific hints such as `ui:widget: "password"` may be supported by some renderers, but they are not part of the core JSON Schema guarantees. Do not assume the standard VTEX Admin App Settings UI will enforce them.
- Read backend settings through `ctx.clients.apps.getAppSettings(ctx.vtex.appId ?? process.env.VTEX_APP_ID)` and centralize normalization or validation in a helper instead of spreading ad hoc access patterns through handlers.
- When reading or saving this app's own settings at runtime, use the correct app identifier such as `process.env.VTEX_APP_ID` or `ctx.vtex.appId` and rely on the app token plus standard app-settings permissions. Do not declare extra License Manager policies in `manifest.json` or add workspace-wide policies such as `read-workspace-apps` or undocumented policies such as `write-workspace-apps` just to "fix" a 403.
- Pixel apps that need configuration should also consume settings through `ctx.clients.apps.getAppSettings(...)` on the backend side of the pixel app. If a value must be available to injected JavaScript, expose only non-sensitive fields through `access: "public"` and `publicSettingsForApp`, keeping secrets strictly on the server side.
- Make code resilient to missing or incomplete settings by validating or applying defaults at the consumption boundary.
- Never assume settings are identical across accounts or workspaces. Each workspace may have different app configuration during development, rollout, or debugging.

Settings vs configuration builder:

- Use `settingsSchema` when the configuration is specific to this app and the merchant is expected to edit it in Apps > App Settings.
- Consider a separate app using the `configuration` builder when the configuration contract needs to be shared across multiple apps, managed separately from the runtime app lifecycle, or injected directly into service context through `ctx.vtex.settings`.
- Prefer a configuration app when the main goal is structured service configuration delivered through VTEX IO runtime context, instead of settings fetched ad hoc by the app itself.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Configurable app behavior must have a schema

Merchant-configurable settings MUST be modeled through an explicit schema instead of ad hoc unvalidated objects.

**Why this matters**

Without a schema, configuration becomes ambiguous, harder to validate, and easier to break across environments.

**Detection**

If code depends on app-level configuration but no schema or validation contract exists, STOP and define it first.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "settingsSchema": {
    "title": "My App Settings",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "enableModeration": {
        "title": "Enable moderation",
        "type": "boolean",
        "default": false,
        "description": "If true, new content will require approval before going live."
      },
      "apiKey": {
        "title": "External API key",
        "type": "string",
        "minLength": 1,
        "description": "API key for the external moderation service.",
        "format": "password"
      },
      "mode": {
        "title": "Mode",
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["sandbox", "production"],
        "default": "sandbox"
      }
    },
    "required": ["apiKey"]
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
const settings = ctx.state.anything
```

### Constraint: Sensitive settings must stay backend-only and must not be exposed to the frontend

Secrets stored in app settings such as API keys, tokens, or passwords MUST be treated as backend-only configuration.

**Why this matters**

App settings are a natural place for secrets, but exposing them in HTTP responses, GraphQL payloads, HTML, or frontend props turns configuration into a security leak.

**Detection**

If a route, resolver, or frontend-facing response returns raw settings or includes sensitive fields from settings, STOP and move the external call or secret usage fully to the backend boundary.

**Correct**

```typescript
const { apiKey } = await ctx.clients.apps.getAppSettings(
  ctx.vtex.appId ?? process.env.VTEX_APP_ID
)
const result = await externalClient.fetchData({ apiKey })

ctx.body = result
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
const settings = await ctx.clients.apps.getAppSettings(
  ctx.vtex.appId ?? process.env.VTEX_APP_ID
)
ctx.body = settings
```

### Constraint: Public app settings access must never expose sensitive configuration

If `settingsSchema.access` is set to `public`, the exposed settings MUST contain only values that are safe to ship to frontend code through `publicSettingsForApp`.

**Why this matters**

`access: "public"` is a delivery choice, not a security control. Once settings are publicly exposed, storefront or frontend code can read them, so secrets and backend-only configuration must never be included there.

**Detection**

If a settings schema marks access as public and includes API keys, tokens, passwords, or any value intended only for backend integrations, STOP and keep those settings private.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "settingsSchema": {
    "title": "Public Storefront Settings",
    "type": "object",
    "access": "public",
    "properties": {
      "bannerText": {
        "title": "Banner text",
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "settingsSchema": {
    "title": "My App Settings",
    "type": "object",
    "access": "public",
    "properties": {
      "apiKey": {
        "title": "External API key",
        "type": "string",
        "format": "password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Constraint: Settings must not be used as operational data storage

App settings MUST represent configuration, not high-volume mutable records.

**Why this matters**

Settings are for configuration boundaries, not for transactional or large-scale operational data.

**Detection**

If a proposed setting stores records that behave like orders, reviews, logs, or queue items, STOP and move that concern to a more appropriate data mechanism.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "enableModeration": true
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "allReviews": []
}
```

### Constraint: Code must validate or default settings at the consumption boundary

Settings-dependent code MUST tolerate missing or incomplete values safely.

**Why this matters**

Configuration can drift across workspaces and accounts. Code that assumes every setting is present becomes fragile.

**Detection**

If code reads settings and assumes required fields always exist with no validation or defaults, STOP and make the dependency explicit.

**Correct**

```typescript
const rawSettings = await ctx.clients.apps.getAppSettings(
  ctx.vtex.appId ?? process.env.VTEX_APP_ID
)
const settings = normalizeSettings(rawSettings)
const enabled = settings.enableModeration ?? false
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
const enabled = settings.enableModeration.value
```

## Preferred pattern

Use settings for stable, merchant-managed configuration, define them with explicit JSON Schema properties, and validate or normalize them where they are consumed.
For secrets, keep the read and the external call on the backend and return only the business result to the frontend.
Use frontend GraphQL access only for intentionally public settings, and keep backend-only settings behind `getAppSettings(...)`.

## Common failure modes

- Using settings as operational storage.
- Using only `type: object` without explicit `properties` and validation details.
- Reading settings without defaults or validation.
- Exposing raw settings or secrets to the frontend.
- Marking settings as `access: "public"` when they contain backend-only or sensitive values.
- Logging settings or secrets in plain text.
- Hardcoding API keys or tokens instead of storing them in app settings.
- Adding workspace-level policies such as `read-workspace-apps` or invalid policies such as `write-workspace-apps` as a generic workaround for app settings permission errors, instead of validating the correct appId and standard app-settings permissions.
- Using `settingsSchema` when the requirement is really block-level Store Framework configuration.
- Creating schemas that are too broad or vague.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Does this data really belong in app settings?
- [ ] Does the `settingsSchema` declare explicit `properties` with clear types and `required` only where necessary?
- [ ] Are sensitive fields represented safely, for example as `string` fields with `format: "password"`, knowing that some consumers such as Apps GraphQL with `hidePasswords` may use that metadata to mask the output?
- [ ] Does the consuming code validate or default missing values?
- [ ] Are secrets kept backend-only and never exposed to the frontend?
- [ ] If `access: "public"` is used, are all exposed settings intentionally safe for frontend consumption?
- [ ] Is the settings surface small and intentional?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when improving vtex io node or .net services for latency, throughput, and resilience: in-process lru, vbase, stale-while-revalidate, appsettings loading, request context, parallel client calls, and avoiding duplicate work. covers application-level performance patterns that complement edge/cdn caching. use when optimizing backends beyond route-level cache-control.

# VTEX IO application performance

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when you optimize **VTEX IO** backends (typically **Node** with `@vtex/api` / Koa-style middleware, or **.NET** services) for **performance and resilience**: **caching**, **deduplicating** work, **parallel I/O**, and **efficient** configuration loading—not only “add a cache.”

- Adding an **in-memory LRU** (per pod) for hot keys
- Adding **VBase** persistence for **shared** cache across pods, optionally with **stale-while-revalidate** (return stale, refresh in background)
- Loading **AppSettings** (or similar) **once** at startup or on a TTL refresh vs **every request**
- **Parallelizing** independent client calls (`Promise.all`) instead of serial waterfalls
- Passing **`ctx.clients`** (e.g. `vbase`) into **client helpers** or resolvers so caches are **testable** and **explicit**

Do not use this skill for:

- Choosing **`/_v/private`** vs public **paths** or **`Cache-Control`** at the edge → **vtex-io-service-paths-and-cdn**
- GraphQL **`@cacheControl`** field semantics only → **vtex-io-graphql-api**

## Decision rules

- **Layer 1 — LRU (in-process)** — Fastest; **lost** on cold start and **not shared** across replicas. Use bounded size + TTL for **hot** keys (organization, cost center, small config slices).
- **Layer 2 — VBase** — **Shared** across pods; platform data is **partitioned** by **account** / **workspace** like other IO resources. Pair with **hash** or `trySaveIfhashMatches` when the client supports concurrency-safe updates (see [Clients](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-clients)).
- **Stale-while-revalidate** — On **VBase hit** with expired **freshness**, return **stale** immediately and **revalidate** asynchronously (fetch origin → write VBase + LRU). Reduces tail latency vs blocking on origin every time.
- **TTL-only** — Simpler: cache until TTL expires, then **blocking** fetch. Prefer when **staleness** is unacceptable or origin is cheap.
- **AppSettings** — If values are **account-wide** and **rarely change**, load **once** (or refresh on interval) and hold in **module memory**; if **workspace-dependent** or **must** reflect admin changes quickly, use **per-request** read or **short TTL** cache. Never cache **secrets** in logs or global state without guardrails.
- **Context** — Use **`ctx.state`** for **per-request** deduplication (e.g. “already loaded org for this request”). Use **global** module cache only for **immutable** or **TTL-refreshed** app data; **account** and **workspace** live on **`ctx.vtex`**—always include them in **in-memory** cache keys when the same pod serves **multiple** tenants.
- **Parallel requests** — When resolvers need **independent** upstream calls, run them **in parallel**; combine only when outputs depend on each other.
- **Timeouts on every outbound call** — Every `ctx.clients` call and external HTTP request **must** have an explicit **timeout**. Use `@vtex/api` client options (`timeout`, `retries`, `exponentialTimeoutCoefficient`) to tune per-client behavior. Unbounded waits are the top cause of cascading failures in distributed systems.
- **Graceful degradation** — When an upstream is slow or down, **fail open** where the business allows (return cached/default data, skip optional enrichment) rather than blocking the response. Consider **circuit breaker** patterns for chronically failing dependencies.
- **Never cache real-time transactional state** — **Order forms**, **cart simulations**, **payment responses**, **full session state**, and **commitment pricing** must never be served from cache. They reflect live, mutable state that changes on every interaction. Caching these creates stale prices, phantom inventory, or duplicate charges.
- **Resolver chain deduplication** — When a resolver chain calls the **same** client method **multiple times** (e.g. `getCostCenter` in the resolver and again inside a helper), **deduplicate**: call once, pass the result through, or stash in `ctx.state`. Serial waterfalls of 7+ calls that could be 3 parallel + 1 sequential are the top performance sink.
- **Phased `Promise.all`** — Group independent calls into **parallel phases**. Phase 1: `Promise.all([getOrderForm(), getCostCenter(), getSession()])`. Phase 2 (depends on Phase 1): `getSkuMetadata()`. Phase 3 (depends on Phase 2): `generatePrice()`. Never `await` six calls sequentially when only two depend on each other.
- **Batch mutations** — When setting multiple values (e.g. `setManualPrice` per cart item), use `Promise.all` instead of a sequential loop. Each `await` in a loop adds a full round-trip.

### VBase deep patterns

- **Per-entity keys, not blob keys** — Cache individual entities (e.g. `sku:{region}:{skuId}`) instead of composite blobs (e.g. `allSkus:{sortedCartSkuIds}`). Per-entity keys dramatically increase cache hit rates when items are added/removed.
- **Minimal DTOs** — Store only the fields the consumer needs (e.g. `{ skuId, mappedId, isSpecialItem }` at ~50 bytes) instead of the full API response (~10-50 KB per product). Reduces VBase storage, serialization time, and transfer size.
- **Sibling prewarming** — When a search API returns a product with 4 SKU variants, cache **all 4** individual SKUs even if only 1 was requested. The next request for a sibling is a VBase hit instead of an API call.
- **Pass `vbase` as a parameter** — Clients don't have direct access to other clients. Pass `ctx.clients.vbase` as a parameter to client methods or utilities that need it. This keeps code testable and explicit about dependencies.
- **VBase state machines** — For long-running operations (scans, imports, batch processing), use VBase as a state store with `current-operation.json` (lock + progress), heartbeat extensions, checkpoint/resume, and TTL-based lock expiry to prevent zombie locks.

### `service.json` tuning

- **`timeout`** — Maximum seconds before the platform kills a request. Set based on the longest expected operation; do not leave at the default if your resolver calls slow upstreams.
- **`memory`** — MB per worker. Increase if LRU caches or large payloads cause OOM; monitor actual usage before over-provisioning.
- **`workers`** — Concurrent request handlers per replica. More workers handle more concurrent requests but each shares the memory budget and in-process LRU.
- **`minReplicas` / `maxReplicas`** — Controls horizontal scaling. For payment-critical or high-throughput apps, set `minReplicas >= 2` so cold starts don't hit production traffic.

### Tenancy and in-memory caches

IO runs **per app version per shard**, with pods **shared across accounts**: every request is still resolved in **`{account, workspace}`** context. **VBase**, app buckets, and related platform stores **partition data** by account/workspace. **In-process** LRU/module `Map` **does not**—you must **key** explicitly with **`ctx.vtex.account`** and **`ctx.vtex.workspace`** (plus entity id) so **two** consecutive requests for **different** accounts on the **same pod** cannot read each other’s entries.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Do not store sensitive or tenant-specific data in module-level caches without tenant keys

**Global** or **module-level** maps must **not** store **PII**, **tokens**, or **authorization-sensitive** blobs keyed only by **user id** or **email** without **`account` and `workspace`** (and any other dimension needed for isolation).

**Why this matters** — Pods are **multi-tenant**: the same process may serve **many** accounts in sequence. **VBase** and similar APIs are **scoped** to the current account/workspace, but an **in-memory** `Map` is **your** responsibility. Missing **`account`/`workspace`** in the key risks **cross-tenant** reads from warm cache.

**Detection** — A module-scope `Map` keyed only by `userId` or `email`; or cache keys that **omit** `ctx.vtex.account` / `ctx.vtex.workspace` when the value is **tenant-specific**.

**Correct** — Build keys from **`ctx.vtex.account`**, **`ctx.vtex.workspace`**, and the entity id; **never** store **app tokens** in VBase/LRU as plain cache values; **prefer** `ctx.clients` and **platform** auth.

```typescript
// Pseudocode: in-memory key must mirror tenant scope (same pod, many accounts)
function cacheKey(ctx: Context, subjectId: string) {
  return `${ctx.vtex.account}:${ctx.vtex.workspace}:${subjectId}`;
}
```

**Wrong** — `globalUserCache.set(email, profile)` keyed **only** by **email**, with **no** `account`/`workspace` segment—**unsafe** on shared pods even though a later **VBase** read would be **account-scoped**, because **this** map is not partitioned by the platform.

### Constraint: Do not use fire-and-forget VBase writes in financial or idempotency-critical paths

When VBase serves as an **idempotency store** (e.g. payment connectors storing transaction state) or a **data-integrity store**, writes **must** be **awaited**. Fire-and-forget writes risk silent failure: a successful upstream operation (e.g. a charge) whose VBase record is lost causes a **duplicate** on the next retry.

**Why this matters** — VTEX Gateway **retries** payment calls with the same `paymentId`. If VBase write fails silently after a successful authorization, the connector cannot find the previous result and sends **another** payment request—causing a **duplicate charge**.

**Detection** — A VBase `saveJSON` or `saveOrUpdate` call **without** `await` in a payment, settlement, refund, or any flow where the stored value is the **only** record preventing re-execution.

**Correct** — Await the write; accept the latency cost for correctness.

```typescript
// Critical path: await guarantees the idempotency record is persisted
await ctx.clients.vbase.saveJSON<Transaction>('transactions', paymentId, transactionData)
return Authorizations.approve(authorization, { ... })
```

**Wrong** — Fire-and-forget in a payment flow.

```typescript
// No await — if this fails silently, the next retry creates a duplicate charge
ctx.clients.vbase.saveJSON('transactions', paymentId, transactionData)
return Authorizations.approve(authorization, { ... })
```

### Constraint: Do not cache real-time transactional data

**Order forms**, **cart simulation responses**, **payment statuses**, **full session state**, and **commitment prices** must **never** be served from LRU, VBase, or any cache layer. They reflect live mutable state.

**Why this matters** — Serving a cached order form shows phantom items, stale prices, or wrong quantities. Caching payment responses could return a previous transaction's status for a different payment. Caching cart simulations returns stale availability and pricing.

**Detection** — LRU or VBase keys like `orderForm:{id}`, `cartSim:{hash}`, `paymentResponse:{id}`, or `session:{token}` used for read-through caching. Or a resolver that caches the result of `checkout.orderForm()`.

**Correct** — Always call the live API for transactional data; cache **reference data** (org, cost center, config, seller lists) around it.

```typescript
// Reference data: cached (changes rarely)
const costCenter = await getCostCenterCached(ctx, costCenterId)
const sellerList = await getSellerListCached(ctx)

// Transactional data: always live
const orderForm = await ctx.clients.checkout.orderForm()
const simulation = await ctx.clients.checkout.simulation(payload)
```

**Wrong** — Caching the order form or cart simulation.

```typescript
const cacheKey = `orderForm:${orderFormId}`
const cached = orderFormCache.get(cacheKey)
if (cached) return cached // Stale cart state served to user
```

### Constraint: Do not block the purchase path on slow or unbounded cache refresh

**Stale-while-revalidate** or **origin** calls **must not** add **unbounded** latency to **checkout-critical** middleware if the platform SLA requires a fast response.

**Why this matters** — Blocking checkout on **optional** enrichment breaks **conversion** and **reliability**.

**Detection** — A **cart** or **payment** resolver **awaits** VBase refresh or **external** API before returning; **no** timeout or **fallback**.

**Correct** — Return **stale** or **default**; **enqueue** refresh; **fail open** where business rules allow.

**Wrong** — `await fetchHeavyPartner()` in the **hot path** with **no** timeout.

## Preferred pattern

1. **Classify** data: **reference data** (org, cost center, config, seller lists → cacheable) vs **transactional data** (order form, cart sim, payment → never cache) vs **user-private** (never in shared cache without encryption and keying).
2. **Choose** LRU only, VBase only, or **LRU → VBase → origin** (two-layer) for **read-heavy** reference data.
3. **Deduplicate** within a request: set **`ctx.state`** flags when a **resolver** chain might call the same loader twice.
4. **Parallelize** independent **`ctx.clients`** calls in **phased** `Promise.all` groups.
5. **Per-entity VBase keys** with minimal DTOs for high-cardinality data (SKUs, users, org records).
6. **Document** TTLs and **invalidation** (who writes, when refresh runs).

### Resolver chain optimization (before/after)

```typescript
// BEFORE: 7 sequential awaits, 2 duplicate calls
const settings = await getAppSettings(ctx)          // 1
const session = await getSessions(ctx)               // 2
const costCenter = await getCostCenter(ctx, ccId)    // 3
const orderForm = await getOrderForm(ctx)            // 4
const skus = await getSkuById(ctx, skuIds)           // 5
const price = await generatePrice(ctx, costCenter)   // 6 (calls getCostCenter AGAIN + getSession AGAIN)
for (const item of items) {
  await setManualPrice(ctx, item)                    // 7, 8, 9... (sequential loop)
}

// AFTER: 3 phases, no duplicates, parallel mutations
const settings = await getAppSettings(ctx)
const [session, costCenter, orderForm] = await Promise.all([
  getSessions(ctx),
  getCostCenter(ctx, ccId),
  getOrderForm(ctx),
])
const skus = await getSkuMetadataBatch(ctx, skuIds)  // per-entity VBase cache
const price = await generatePrice(ctx, costCenter, session)  // reuse, no re-fetch
await Promise.all(items.map(item => setManualPrice(ctx, item)))
```

### Per-entity VBase caching

```typescript
interface SkuMetadata {
  skuId: string
  mappedSku: string | null
  isSpecialItem: boolean
}

async function getSkuMetadataBatch(
  ctx: Context,
  skuIds: string[],
): Promise<Map<string, SkuMetadata>> {
  const { vbase, search } = ctx.clients
  const results = new Map<string, SkuMetadata>()

  // Phase 1: check VBase for each SKU in parallel
  const lookups = await Promise.allSettled(
    skuIds.map(id => vbase.getJSON<SkuMetadata>('sku-metadata', `sku:${id}`))
  )

  const missing: string[] = []
  lookups.forEach((result, i) => {
    if (result.status === 'fulfilled' && result.value) {
      results.set(skuIds[i], result.value)
    } else {
      missing.push(skuIds[i])
    }
  })

  if (missing.length === 0) return results

  // Phase 2: fetch only missing SKUs from API
  const products = await search.getSkuById(missing)

  // Phase 3: cache ALL sibling SKUs (prewarm)
  for (const product of products) {
    for (const sku of product.items) {
      const metadata: SkuMetadata = {
        skuId: sku.itemId,
        mappedSku: extractMapping(sku),
        isSpecialItem: checkSpecial(sku),
      }
      results.set(sku.itemId, metadata)
      // Fire-and-forget for prewarming (not idempotency-critical)
      vbase.saveJSON('sku-metadata', `sku:${sku.itemId}`, metadata).catch(() => {})
    }
  }

  return results
}
```

## Common failure modes

- **LRU unbounded** — Memory grows without **max** entries; pod **OOM**.
- **VBase without LRU** — Every request hits **VBase** for **hot** keys; **latency** and **cost** rise.
- **In-memory cache without tenant in key** — Same pod serves account A then B; **stale** or **wrong** row returned from module cache.
- **Serial awaits** — Three **independent** Janus calls **awaited** one after another; total latency = sum of all instead of max.
- **Duplicate calls in resolver chains** — `getCostCenter` called in the resolver and again inside a helper; `getSession` called twice in the same flow. Each duplicate adds a full round-trip.
- **Blob VBase keys** — Keying VBase by `sortedCartSkuIds` means adding 1 item to a cart of 10 requires a full re-fetch instead of 1 lookup.
- **Caching transactional data** — Order forms, cart simulations, payment responses served from cache; stale prices, phantom items, or duplicate charges.
- **Fire-and-forget writes in critical paths** — Unawaited VBase writes for idempotency stores; silent failure causes duplicates on retry.
- **No explicit timeouts** — Relying on default or infinite timeouts for upstream calls; one slow dependency stalls the whole request chain.
- **Global mutable singletons** — Module-level mutable objects (e.g. token cache metadata) modified by concurrent requests cause race conditions and incorrect behavior.
- **Treating AppSettings as real-time** — **Stale** admin change until **TTL** expires; **no** notification path.
- **`console.log` in hot paths** — Logging full response objects with template literals produces `[object Object]`; use `ctx.vtex.logger` with `JSON.stringify` and redact sensitive data.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Are **in-memory** cache keys built with **`account` + `workspace`** (and entity id) when values are tenant-specific?
- [ ] Is **LRU** bounded (max entries) and **TTL** defined?
- [ ] For **VBase**, is **stale-while-revalidate** or **TTL-only** behavior **explicit**?
- [ ] Are **independent** upstream calls **parallelized** (`Promise.all` phases) where safe?
- [ ] Are there **no duplicate calls** to the same client method within a resolver chain?
- [ ] Is **AppSettings** (or similar) **loaded** at the right **frequency** (once vs per request)?
- [ ] Is **checkout** or **payment** path **free** of **blocking** optional refreshes?
- [ ] Does every outbound call have an explicit **timeout** (via `@vtex/api` client options or equivalent)?
- [ ] For unreliable upstreams, is there a **degradation** path (cached fallback, skip, circuit breaker)?
- [ ] Are VBase writes **awaited** in financial or idempotency-critical paths?
- [ ] Is **transactional data** (order form, cart sim, payment) always fetched live, never from cache?
- [ ] Are VBase keys **per-entity** (not blob) for high-cardinality data like SKUs?
- [ ] Are `service.json` resource limits (`timeout`, `memory`, `workers`, `replicas`) tuned for the workload?
- [ ] Is logging done via `ctx.vtex.logger` (not `console.log`) with sensitive data redacted?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when deciding or implementing permissions and authorization boundaries for vtex io apps. covers manifest policies, outbound-access rules, least-privilege design, and how service routes or integrations map to explicit permissions. use for deciding who is authorized to call or consume a capability, adding new integrations, exposing protected routes, or reviewing app permissions for overreach or missing access.

# Authorization & Policy Design

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when a VTEX IO app needs explicit permissions to call external services, consume VTEX resources, or expose access-controlled behavior.

- Adding an external API integration
- Consuming VTEX resources that require declared permissions
- Reviewing whether a route or client needs policy changes
- Tightening app permissions around an existing integration

Do not use this skill for:
- service runtime tuning
- HTTP handler structure
- frontend UI authorization behavior
- broader trust-boundary or sensitive-data modeling
- choosing between `AUTH_TOKEN`, `STORE_TOKEN`, and `ADMIN_TOKEN`

## Decision rules

- Treat `manifest.json` policies as explicit declarations of what the app is allowed to access.
- Use this skill to decide what the app is authorized to do, not which runtime token identity should make the call.
- Add only the policies required for the integrations and resources the app actually uses.
- Use License Manager policies when the app needs access to VTEX platform resources protected by LM resource keys.
- Use app policies such as `"vendor.app-name:policy-name"` when the app consumes resources or operations exposed by another VTEX IO app through role-based policies.
- Use `outbound-access` when the app needs to call external HTTP services or URLs that are not covered by License Manager or app policies.
- Prefer narrowly scoped outbound-access declarations over wildcard hosts or paths.
- When exposing your own routes or operations, define access on the server side through resource-based policies, route protections, or auth directives instead of assuming consumers will declare something in their own manifest.
- A VRN (VTEX Resource Name) is the internal identifier format VTEX uses for resources and identities. Role-based policies use `resources` expressed as VRNs, and resource-based policies use `principals` expressed as VRNs.
- Use VRNs only where the platform expects them, especially in `service.json` resource-based policies or when interpreting authorization errors. Do not generate VRNs in `manifest.json` for consumer-side policy declarations.
- In resource-based policies, multiple `principals` are evaluated as alternatives, and explicit `deny` rules override `allow` rules.
- When exposing your own role-based policies, keep them minimal and operation-specific rather than broad catch-all permissions.
- Review policy requirements when adding a new client, external integration, or service route that depends on protected access.
- Keep route implementation and policy declaration aligned: if a route depends on a protected integration, make sure the permission boundary is visible and intentional.

Policy types at a glance:

- License Manager policy:

```json
{
  "policies": [
    { "name": "Sku.aspx" }
  ]
}
```

- App policy:

```json
{
  "policies": [
    { "name": "vtex.messages:graphql-translate-messages" }
  ]
}
```

- Outbound-access policy:

```json
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "outbound-access",
      "attrs": {
        "host": "partner.example.com",
        "path": "/api/*"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- Resource-based route policy with app principal VRN:

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "privateStatus": {
      "path": "/_v/private/status/:code",
      "public": false,
      "policies": [
        {
          "effect": "allow",
          "actions": ["POST"],
          "principals": [
            "vrn:apps:*:my-sponsor-account:*:app/vendor.partner-app@0.x"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This route allows a specific IO app principal. Other apps remain denied by default because they do not match any allow rule.

- Resource-based route policy with VTEX ID principal VRN:

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "status": {
      "path": "/_v/status/:code",
      "public": false,
      "policies": [
        {
          "effect": "allow",
          "actions": ["POST"],
          "principals": [
            "vrn:vtex.vtex-id:-:bibi:-:user/vtexappkey-mcc77-HBXYAE"
          ]
        },
        {
          "effect": "deny",
          "actions": ["POST"],
          "principals": [
            "vrn:vtex.vtex-id:-:bibi:-:user/*@vtex.com"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This is an advanced pattern for integrations that identify callers through a specific VTEX ID principal, including appkey-based contracts. Prefer app VRNs for IO-to-IO access when the caller is another VTEX IO app. VTEX IO auth tokens such as `AUTH_TOKEN`, `STORE_TOKEN`, and `ADMIN_TOKEN` play a different role: they authenticate requests to VTEX services and help preserve requester context, but they do not automatically replace route-level resource policies based on VRN principals.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Every protected integration must have an explicit supporting policy

If a client or route depends on access controlled by License Manager policies, role-based app policies, or `outbound-access`, the app MUST declare the corresponding permission explicitly in `manifest.json`. Resources protected by resource-based policies define access on the server side and do not require consumer apps to declare additional policies just for that server-side enforcement.

**Why this matters**

Without the required policy, the code may be correct but the platform will still block the access at runtime, leading to failures that are hard to debug from handler code alone.

**Detection**

If you see a new external host, VTEX resource, or protected capability being consumed, STOP and verify that the required consumer-side policy exists before merging the code. If the app is exposing a protected route or operation, STOP and confirm that the access rule is also enforced on the server side.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "outbound-access",
      "attrs": {
        "host": "partner.example.com",
        "path": "/api/*"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "policies": []
}
```

### Constraint: Outbound policies must follow least privilege

Outbound-access policies MUST be scoped as narrowly as practical for the target host and path.

**Why this matters**

Broad outbound rules increase risk, make reviews harder, and allow integrations to expand silently beyond their intended surface.

**Detection**

If you see wildcard hosts or overly broad paths when the integration uses a much smaller surface, STOP and narrow the declaration.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "name": "outbound-access",
  "attrs": {
    "host": "partner.example.com",
    "path": "/orders/*"
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "name": "outbound-access",
  "attrs": {
    "host": "*",
    "path": "/*"
  }
}
```

### Constraint: Policy changes must be reviewed together with the behavior they enable

When a policy is added or widened, the route or integration behavior that depends on it MUST be reviewed in the same change.

**Why this matters**

Permissions are meaningful only in context. Reviewing a policy change without the code that consumes it makes overreach and hidden side effects easier to miss.

**Detection**

If a PR changes `manifest.json` permissions without showing the relevant route, client, or integration code, STOP and request the linked behavior before approving.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "outbound-access",
      "attrs": {
        "host": "partner.example.com",
        "path": "/orders/*"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "outbound-access",
      "attrs": {
        "host": "partner.example.com",
        "path": "/api/*"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This broader policy alone does not explain why the app needs the expanded access.

## Preferred pattern

Start from the client or route behavior, identify the minimal access needed, and declare only that permission in `manifest.json`. When the app exposes protected routes or operations, define the resource-based access rule on the server side as part of the same review.

Example pattern:

```json
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "outbound-access",
      "attrs": {
        "host": "partner.example.com",
        "path": "/orders/*"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Review permissions whenever integrations change, not only when policy errors appear in runtime.

## Common failure modes

- Forgetting the outbound-access policy for a new external integration.
- Using an outbound-access policy when the real requirement is a License Manager resource key or an app policy exposed by another VTEX IO app.
- Using wildcard hosts or paths when a narrower declaration would work.
- Assuming consumer apps must declare manifest policies for resources that are actually enforced through resource-based policies on the server side.
- Adding permissions without reviewing the route or client behavior they enable.
- Treating policy failures as code bugs instead of permission bugs.
- Treating a `403` that names a VRN resource or principal as a handler bug instead of an authorization or policy-mapping problem.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Does every protected integration have an explicit policy?
- [ ] Is the policy type correct for the access pattern: License Manager, app policy, or outbound-access?
- [ ] Are outbound-access rules narrow enough for the real integration surface?
- [ ] If the app exposes protected routes or operations, is server-side access control defined explicitly as well?
- [ ] Is the policy change reviewed together with the route or client that needs it?
- [ ] Are wildcard permissions avoided unless strictly necessary?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when choosing which vtex io authentication token should back a request from a backend app. covers `ctx.authtoken`, `ctx.storeuserauthtoken`, `ctx.adminuserauthtoken`, `authmethod`, and how requester context should determine the identity used by vtex clients. use for deciding which identity talks to vtex endpoints in storefront-backed requests, admin actions, or app-level integrations that should avoid hardcoded vtex credentials.

# Auth Tokens & Request Context

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when the main decision is which VTEX IO identity should authenticate a backend request to VTEX services.

- Choosing between `ctx.authToken`, `ctx.storeUserAuthToken`, and `ctx.adminUserAuthToken`
- Deciding whether a VTEX client call should use `AUTH_TOKEN`, `STORE_TOKEN`, or `ADMIN_TOKEN`
- Reviewing storefront and Admin integrations that should respect the current user identity
- Replacing hardcoded `appKey` and `appToken` usage inside a VTEX IO app

Do not use this skill for:
- deciding which policies belong in `manifest.json`
- modeling route-level authorization or resource-based policies
- choosing between `ExternalClient`, `JanusClient`, and other client abstractions
- browser-side login or session UX flows
- validating route input or deciding what data may cross the app boundary

## Decision rules

- Use this skill to decide which identity talks to VTEX endpoints, not what that identity is authorized to do.
- Use `AUTH_TOKEN` with `ctx.authToken` only for app-level operations that are not tied to a current shopper or Admin user.
- Use `STORE_TOKEN` with `ctx.storeUserAuthToken` whenever the action comes from storefront browsing or a shopper-triggered flow and the integration should respect shopper permissions.
- Use `ADMIN_TOKEN` with `ctx.adminUserAuthToken` whenever the action comes from an Admin interface and the integration should respect the logged-in Admin user's License Manager permissions.
- Prefer user tokens whenever they are available. The official guidance is to avoid app-token authentication when a store or Admin user token can represent the requester more accurately.
- If the corresponding user token is not present, fall back to `AUTH_TOKEN` only when the operation is truly app-scoped and does not depend on a current shopper or Admin identity.
- When using VTEX IO clients that accept `authMethod`, pass the token choice explicitly when the default app identity is not the right one for the request.
- When wrapping custom VTEX clients, propagate the matching auth token from `IOContext` at the client boundary instead of hardcoding credentials in handlers.
- Keep token choice aligned with the user journey: storefront flows should not silently escalate to app-level permissions, and Admin flows should not bypass the current Admin role context.
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` with `ctx.adminUserAuthToken` must remain server-side only and must never be exposed or proxied to browser clients.
- Treat token choice and policy design as separate concerns: this skill decides which identity is making the call, while auth-and-policies decides what that identity is allowed to do.
- Do not use `appKey` and `appToken` inside a VTEX IO app unless there is a documented exception outside the normal VTEX IO auth-token model.
- Never log raw tokens or return them in responses. Tokens are request secrets, and downstream callers should receive only business data.

Token selection at a glance:

| Token | Context field | Use when | Avoid when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_TOKEN` | `ctx.authToken` | app-level jobs, service-to-service work, or operations not linked to a current user | a shopper or Admin user is already driving the action |
| `STORE_TOKEN` | `ctx.storeUserAuthToken` | storefront and shopper-triggered operations | backend jobs or Admin-only operations |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | `ctx.adminUserAuthToken` | Admin requests that must respect the current user's LM role | storefront flows or background app tasks |

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: User-driven requests must prefer user tokens over the app token

If a request is initiated by a current shopper or Admin user, the VTEX integration MUST use the corresponding user token instead of defaulting to the app token.

**Why this matters**

Using the app token for user-driven work widens permissions unnecessarily and disconnects the request from the real user context that should govern access.

**Detection**

If the code runs in a storefront or Admin request path and still uses `ctx.authToken` or implicit app-token behavior, STOP and verify whether `ctx.storeUserAuthToken` or `ctx.adminUserAuthToken` should be used instead.

**Correct**

```typescript
export class OmsClient extends JanusClient {
  constructor(ctx: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super(ctx, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        ...options?.headers,
        VtexIdclientAutCookie: ctx.storeUserAuthToken,
      },
    })
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
export class OmsClient extends JanusClient {
  constructor(ctx: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super(ctx, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        ...options?.headers,
        VtexIdclientAutCookie: ctx.authToken,
      },
    })
  }
}
```

### Constraint: App tokens must be reserved for app-level operations that are not tied to a user

Use `ctx.authToken` only when the request is genuinely app-scoped and no current shopper or Admin identity should govern the action.

**Why this matters**

The app token carries the permissions declared in the app manifest. Using it for user-triggered actions can bypass the narrower shopper or Admin permission model that the platform expects.

**Detection**

If a request originates from an Admin page, storefront interaction, or another user-facing workflow, STOP before using `ctx.authToken` and confirm that the action is truly app-level rather than user-scoped.

**Correct**

```typescript
export class RatesAndBenefitsClient extends JanusClient {
  constructor(ctx: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super(ctx, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        ...options?.headers,
        VtexIdclientAutCookie: ctx.authToken,
      },
    })
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
export class AdminOrdersClient extends JanusClient {
  constructor(ctx: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super(ctx, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        ...options?.headers,
        VtexIdclientAutCookie: ctx.authToken,
      },
    })
  }
}
```

This is wrong when the client is used from an Admin flow that should respect the logged-in user's role.

### Constraint: VTEX IO apps must not hardcode VTEX API credentials when auth tokens are available

A VTEX IO app MUST use tokens from `IOContext` or `authMethod` instead of embedding `appKey`, `appToken`, or static VTEX credentials in source code or routine runtime configuration.

**Why this matters**

Hardcoded VTEX credentials are harder to rotate, easier to leak, and bypass the request-context model that VTEX IO clients already support.

**Detection**

If you see `X-VTEX-API-AppKey`, `X-VTEX-API-AppToken`, raw VTEX API credentials, or environment variables carrying permanent VTEX credentials inside a normal IO app integration, STOP and replace them with the correct auth-token flow unless there is a documented exception.

**Correct**

```typescript
await ctx.clients.catalog.getSkuById(id, {
  authMethod: 'ADMIN_TOKEN',
})
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
await fetch(`https://${ctx.vtex.account}.myvtex.com/api/catalog/pvt/stockkeepingunit/${id}`, {
  headers: {
    'X-VTEX-API-AppKey': process.env.VTEX_APP_KEY!,
    'X-VTEX-API-AppToken': process.env.VTEX_APP_TOKEN!,
  },
})
```

## Preferred pattern

Start from the requester context, choose the token identity that matches that requester, and keep the token propagation inside the client layer.

Minimal selection guide:

```text
storefront request -> STORE_TOKEN / ctx.storeUserAuthToken
admin request -> ADMIN_TOKEN / ctx.adminUserAuthToken
background app work -> AUTH_TOKEN / ctx.authToken
```

Pass the token explicitly when the client supports `authMethod`:

```typescript
await ctx.clients.orders.listOrders({
  authMethod: 'ADMIN_TOKEN',
})
```

```typescript
await ctx.clients.orders.listOrders({
  authMethod: 'STORE_TOKEN',
})
```

Or inject the matching token in a custom VTEX client:

```typescript
import type { IOContext, InstanceOptions } from '@vtex/api'
import { JanusClient } from '@vtex/api'

export class OmsClient extends JanusClient {
  constructor(ctx: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super(ctx, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        ...options?.headers,
        VtexIdclientAutCookie: ctx.adminUserAuthToken,
      },
    })
  }
}
```

Keep the decision close to the request boundary, then let downstream handlers and services depend on the correctly configured client rather than choosing tokens ad hoc in many places.

## Common failure modes

- Defaulting every VTEX request to `ctx.authToken`, even when a shopper or Admin user initiated the action.
- Using `ctx.authToken` in Admin pages and accidentally bypassing the current Admin user's License Manager role context.
- Using `ctx.authToken` in storefront flows that should be limited by shopper permissions.
- Hardcoding `appKey` and `appToken` in an IO app instead of using auth tokens from `IOContext`.
- Choosing the right token in one client method but forgetting to apply the same identity consistently across related calls.
- Mixing token choice with policy modeling and treating them as the same decision.
- Logging `ctx.authToken`, `ctx.storeUserAuthToken`, or `ctx.adminUserAuthToken` in plain text, or forwarding raw tokens to downstream services that do not need them.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Does each VTEX integration use the correct requester identity: shopper, Admin user, or app?
- [ ] Are `ctx.storeUserAuthToken` and `ctx.adminUserAuthToken` preferred when a user is actually driving the action?
- [ ] Is `ctx.authToken` used only for app-level operations that are not tied to a current user?
- [ ] Are hardcoded VTEX credentials absent from normal IO app integrations?
- [ ] Is token propagation centralized in the client layer or explicit `authMethod` usage rather than scattered across handlers?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when designing or implementing how a vtex io backend app integrates with vtex services or external apis through @vtex/api and @vtex/clients. covers choosing the correct client type, registering clients in ioclients, configuring instanceoptions, and consuming integrations through ctx.clients. use for custom client design, vtex core commerce integrations, or reviewing backend code that should use vtex io client patterns instead of raw http libraries.

# Client Integration & Service Access

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when the main decision is how a VTEX IO backend app should call VTEX services or external APIs through the VTEX IO client system.

- Creating custom clients under `node/clients/`
- Choosing between native clients from `@vtex/api` or `@vtex/clients` and a custom client
- Registering clients in `IOClients` and exposing them through `ctx.clients`
- Configuring `InstanceOptions` such as retries, timeout, headers, or caching
- Reviewing backend integrations that currently use raw HTTP libraries

Do not use this skill for:
- deciding the app contract in `manifest.json`
- structuring `node/index.ts` or tuning `service.json`
- designing GraphQL schema or resolver contracts
- modeling route authorization or security permissions
- building storefront or admin frontend integrations

## Decision rules

- Prefer native clients from `@vtex/api` or `@vtex/clients` when they already cover the target VTEX service. Common examples include clients for catalog, checkout, logistics, and OMS. Write a custom client only when no suitable native client or factory exists.
- Use `ExternalClient` primarily for non-VTEX external APIs. Avoid using it for VTEX-hosted endpoints such as `*.myvtex.com` or `*.vtexcommercestable.com.br` when a native client in `@vtex/clients`, `JanusClient`, or another documented higher-level VTEX client is available or more appropriate.
- Janus is VTEX's Core Commerce API gateway. Use `JanusClient` only when you need to call a VTEX Core Commerce API through Janus and no suitable native client from `@vtex/clients` already exists.
- Use `InfraClient` only for advanced integrations with VTEX IO infrastructure services under explicit documented guidance. In partner apps, prefer higher-level clients and factories such as `masterData` or `vbase` instead of extending `InfraClient` directly.
- Register every custom or native client in `node/clients/index.ts` through a `Clients` class that extends `IOClients`.
- Consume integrations through `ctx.clients`, never by instantiating client classes inside middlewares, resolvers, or event handlers.
- Keep clients focused on transport, request options, endpoint paths, and small response shaping. Keep business rules, authorization decisions, and orchestration outside the client.
- When building custom clients, always rely on the `IOContext` passed by VTEX IO such as `account`, `workspace`, and available auth tokens instead of hardcoding account names, workspaces, or environment-specific VTEX URLs.
- Configure shared `InstanceOptions` in the runtime client config, then use client-specific overrides only when an integration has clearly different needs.
- Use the `metric` option on important client calls so integrations can be tracked and monitored at the client layer, not only at the handler layer.
- Keep error normalization close to the client boundary, but avoid hiding relevant HTTP status codes or transport failures that are important for observability and debugging.
- When integrating with external services, confirm that the required outbound policies are declared in the app contract, but keep the detailed policy modeling in auth or app-contract skills.
- In rare migration or legacy scenarios, `ExternalClient` may temporarily be used against VTEX-hosted endpoints, but treat this as an exception. The long-term goal should be to move toward native clients or the proper documented VTEX client abstractions so routing, authentication, and observability stay consistent.

Client selection guide:

| Client type | Use when | Avoid when |
|---|---|---|
| `ExternalClient` | calling non-VTEX external APIs | VTEX-hosted APIs that already have a native client or Janus-based abstraction |
| `JanusClient` | calling VTEX Core Commerce APIs not yet wrapped by `@vtex/clients` | any VTEX service that already has a native client such as Catalog, Checkout, Logistics, or OMS |
| `InfraClient` | implementing advanced infra-style clients only under explicit documented guidance | general VTEX or external APIs in partner apps |

InstanceOptions heuristics:

- Start with small, explicit client defaults such as `retries: 2` and a request `timeout` between `1000` and `3000` milliseconds.
- Use small finite retry values such as `1` to `3` for idempotent operations.
- Avoid automatic retries on non-idempotent operations unless the upstream API explicitly documents safe idempotency behavior.
- Do not use high retry counts to hide upstream instability. Surface repeated failures clearly and handle them intentionally in the business layer.
- Prefer per-client headers and metrics instead of scattering header definitions through handlers.
- Use memory or disk cache options only when repeated reads justify it and the response can be safely reused.
- Keep auth setup inside the client constructor or factory configuration, not duplicated across handlers.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: All service-to-service HTTP calls must go through VTEX IO clients

HTTP communication from a VTEX IO backend app MUST go through `@vtex/api` or `@vtex/clients` clients. Do not use raw libraries such as `axios`, `fetch`, `got`, or `node-fetch` for service integrations.

**Why this matters**

VTEX IO clients provide transport behavior that raw libraries bypass, including authentication context, retries, metrics, caching options, and infrastructure-aware request execution. Raw HTTP calls make integrations harder to observe and easier to misconfigure.

**Detection**

If you see `axios`, `fetch`, `got`, `node-fetch`, or direct ad hoc HTTP code in a VTEX IO backend service, STOP and replace it with an appropriate VTEX IO client pattern.

**Correct**

```typescript
import type { IOContext, InstanceOptions } from '@vtex/api'
import { ExternalClient } from '@vtex/api'

export class WeatherClient extends ExternalClient {
  constructor(context: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super('https://api.weather.com', context, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        'X-VTEX-Account': context.account,
        'X-VTEX-Workspace': context.workspace,
        'X-Api-Key': process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY,
        ...options?.headers,
      },
    })
  }

  public getForecast(city: string) {
    return this.http.get(`/v1/forecast/${city}`, {
      metric: 'weather-forecast',
    })
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
import axios from 'axios'

export async function getForecast(city: string) {
  const response = await axios.get(`https://api.weather.com/v1/forecast/${city}`, {
    headers: {
      'X-Api-Key': process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return response.data
}
```

### Constraint: Clients must be registered in IOClients and consumed through ctx.clients

Clients MUST be registered in the `Clients` class that extends `IOClients`, and middlewares, resolvers, or event handlers MUST access them through `ctx.clients`.

**Why this matters**

The VTEX IO client registry ensures the current request context, options, caching behavior, and instrumentation are applied consistently. Direct instantiation inside handlers bypasses that shared lifecycle and creates fragile integration code.

**Detection**

If you see `new MyClient(...)` inside a middleware, resolver, or event handler, STOP. Move the client into `node/clients/`, register it in `IOClients`, and consume it through `ctx.clients`.

**Correct**

```typescript
import { IOClients } from '@vtex/api'
import { Catalog } from '@vtex/clients'

export class Clients extends IOClients {
  public get catalog() {
    return this.getOrSet('catalog', Catalog)
  }
}
```

```typescript
export async function getSku(ctx: Context) {
  const sku = await ctx.clients.catalog.getSkuById(ctx.vtex.route.params.id)
  ctx.body = sku
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
import { Catalog } from '@vtex/clients'

export async function getSku(ctx: Context) {
  const catalog = new Catalog(ctx.vtex, {})
  const sku = await catalog.getSkuById(ctx.vtex.route.params.id)
  ctx.body = sku
}
```

### Constraint: Choose the narrowest client type that matches the integration boundary

Each integration MUST use the correct client abstraction for its boundary. Do not default every integration to `ExternalClient` or `JanusClient` when a more specific client type or native package already exists.

**Why this matters**

The client type communicates intent and shapes how authentication, URLs, and service boundaries are handled. Using the wrong abstraction makes the integration harder to understand and more likely to drift from VTEX IO conventions.

**Detection**

If the target is a VTEX Core Commerce API, STOP and check whether a native client from `@vtex/clients` or `JanusClient` is more appropriate than `ExternalClient`. If the target is VTEX-hosted, STOP and confirm that there is no more specific documented VTEX client abstraction before defaulting to `ExternalClient`.

**Correct**

```typescript
import type { IOContext, InstanceOptions } from '@vtex/api'
import { JanusClient } from '@vtex/api'

export class RatesAndBenefitsClient extends JanusClient {
  constructor(context: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super(context, options)
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
import type { IOContext, InstanceOptions } from '@vtex/api'
import { ExternalClient } from '@vtex/api'

export class RatesAndBenefitsClient extends ExternalClient {
  constructor(context: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super(`https://${context.account}.vtexcommercestable.com.br`, context, options)
  }
}
```

## Preferred pattern

Recommended file layout:

```text
node/
├── clients/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── catalog.ts
│   └── partnerApi.ts
├── middlewares/
│   └── getData.ts
└── index.ts
```

Register native and custom clients in one place:

```typescript
import { IOClients } from '@vtex/api'
import { Catalog } from '@vtex/clients'
import { PartnerApiClient } from './partnerApi'

export class Clients extends IOClients {
  public get catalog() {
    return this.getOrSet('catalog', Catalog)
  }

  public get partnerApi() {
    return this.getOrSet('partnerApi', PartnerApiClient)
  }
}
```

Create custom clients with explicit routes and options:

```typescript
import type { IOContext, InstanceOptions } from '@vtex/api'
import { ExternalClient } from '@vtex/api'

export class PartnerApiClient extends ExternalClient {
  private routes = {
    order: (id: string) => `/orders/${id}`,
  }

  constructor(context: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super('https://partner.example.com', context, {
      ...options,
      retries: 2,
      timeout: 2000,
      headers: {
        'X-VTEX-Account': context.account,
        'X-VTEX-Workspace': context.workspace,
        ...options?.headers,
      },
    })
  }

  public getOrder(id: string) {
    return this.http.get(this.routes.order(id), {
      metric: 'partner-get-order',
    })
  }
}
```

Wire shared client options in the runtime:

```typescript
import type { ClientsConfig } from '@vtex/api'
import { Clients } from './clients'

const clients: ClientsConfig<Clients> = {
  implementation: Clients,
  options: {
    default: {
      retries: 2,
      timeout: 2000,
    },
  },
}
```

Use clients from handlers through `ctx.clients`:

```typescript
export async function getOrder(ctx: Context) {
  const order = await ctx.clients.partnerApi.getOrder(ctx.vtex.route.params.id)
  ctx.body = order
}
```

If a client file grows too large, split it by bounded integration domains and keep `node/clients/index.ts` as a small registry.

## Common failure modes

- Using `axios`, `fetch`, or other raw HTTP libraries in backend handlers instead of VTEX IO clients.
- Instantiating clients directly inside handlers instead of registering them in `IOClients`.
- Choosing `ExternalClient` when a native VTEX client or a more specific app client already exists.
- Putting business rules, validation, or orchestration into clients instead of keeping them as transport wrappers.
- Scattering headers, auth setup, and retry settings across handlers instead of centralizing them in the client or shared client config.
- Forgetting the outbound-access policy required for an external integration declared in a custom client.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Does each integration use the correct VTEX IO client abstraction?
- [ ] Are native clients from `@vtex/api` or `@vtex/clients` preferred when available?
- [ ] Are clients registered in `IOClients` and consumed through `ctx.clients`?
- [ ] Are raw HTTP libraries absent from the backend integration code?
- [ ] Are retries, timeouts, headers, and metrics configured in the client layer rather than scattered across handlers?
- [ ] Are business rules kept out of the client layer?

- Deciding whether to use app settings, configuration apps, Master Data, VBase, or VTEX core APIs
- Reviewing code that reads or writes large, duplicated, or critical datasets
- Introducing caching layers or derived local views around existing APIs

Do not use this skill for:
- detailed Master Data schema or entity modeling
- app settings or configuration app schema design
- auth tokens or policies such as `AUTH_TOKEN`, `STORE_TOKEN`, or manifest permissions
- service runtime sizing or concurrency tuning

## Decision rules

### Choose the right home for each kind of data

- Use app settings or configuration apps for stable configuration managed by merchants or operators, such as feature flags, credentials, external base URLs, and behavior toggles.
- Use Master Data for structured custom business records that belong to the account and need validation, filtering, search, pagination, or lifecycle management.
- Use VBase for simple keyed documents, auxiliary snapshots, or cache-like JSON payloads that are usually read by key rather than searched broadly.
- Use VTEX core APIs when the data already belongs to a VTEX core domain such as orders, catalog, pricing, or logistics.
- Use external stores or external APIs when the data belongs to another system and VTEX IO is only integrating with it.

### Keep source of truth explicit

- Treat VTEX core APIs as the source of truth for core commerce domains such as orders, products, prices, inventory, and similar platform-owned data.
- Do not mirror complete orders, catalog records, prices, or inventories into Master Data or VBase unless there is a narrow derived use case with clear ownership.
- If an IO app needs a local copy, store only the minimal fields or derived view required for that app and rehydrate full details from the authoritative source when needed.
- Do not use app settings or configuration apps as generic operational data stores.

### Design reads and caches intentionally

- Prefer API-level filtering, pagination, field selection, and bounded reads instead of loading full datasets into Node and filtering in memory.
- Use caching only when repeated reads justify it and the cached view has clear invalidation or freshness rules.
- When a background job or event pipeline needs persistent processing state, store only the status and correlation data required for retries and idempotency.
- Keep long-lived logs, traces, or unbounded histories out of Master Data and VBase unless the use case explicitly requires a durable app-owned audit trail.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Configuration stores must not be used as operational data storage

App settings and configuration apps MUST represent configuration, not transactional records, unbounded lists, or frequently changing operational state.

**Why this matters**

Using configuration stores as data storage blurs system boundaries, makes workspace behavior harder to reason about, and breaks expectations for tools and flows that depend on settings being small and stable.

**Detection**

If you see arrays of records, logs, histories, orders, or other growing operational payloads inside `settingsSchema`, configuration app payloads, or settings-related APIs, STOP and move that data to Master Data, VBase, a core API, or an external store.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "settingsSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "enableModeration": {
        "type": "boolean"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "settingsSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "orders": {
        "type": "array"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Constraint: Core systems must remain the source of truth for their domains

VTEX core systems such as Orders, Catalog, Pricing, and Logistics MUST remain the primary source of truth for their own business domains.

**Why this matters**

Treating a local IO copy as the main store for core domains creates reconciliation drift, stale reads, and business decisions based on outdated data.

**Detection**

If an app stores full order payloads, product documents, inventory snapshots, or price tables in Master Data or VBase and then uses those copies as the main source for business decisions, STOP and redesign the flow around the authoritative upstream source.

**Correct**

```typescript
const order = await ctx.clients.oms.getOrder(orderId)

ctx.body = {
  orderId: order.orderId,
  status: order.status,
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
const cachedOrder = await ctx.clients.masterdata.getDocument({
  dataEntity: 'ORD',
  id: orderId,
})

ctx.body = cachedOrder
```

### Constraint: Data-heavy reads must avoid full scans and in-memory filtering

Large or growing datasets MUST be accessed through bounded queries, filters, pagination, or precomputed derived views instead of full scans and broad in-memory filtering.

**Why this matters**

Unbounded reads are inefficient, hard to scale, and easy to turn into fragile service behavior as the dataset grows.

**Detection**

If you see code that fetches entire collections from Master Data, VTEX APIs, or external stores and then filters or aggregates the result in Node for a normal request flow, STOP and redesign the access path.

**Correct**

```typescript
const documents = await ctx.clients.masterdata.searchDocuments({
  dataEntity: 'RV',
  fields: ['id', 'status'],
  where: 'status=approved',
  pagination: {
    page: 1,
    pageSize: 20,
  },
})
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
const allDocuments = await ctx.clients.masterdata.scrollDocuments({
  dataEntity: 'RV',
  fields: ['id', 'status'],
})

const approved = allDocuments.filter((doc) => doc.status === 'approved')
```

## Preferred pattern

Start every data design with four questions:

1. Whose data is this?
2. Who is the source of truth?
3. How will the app query it?
4. Does the app really need to store a local copy?

Then choose intentionally:

- app settings or configuration apps for stable configuration
- Master Data for structured custom records owned by the app domain
- VBase for simple keyed documents or cache-like payloads
- VTEX core APIs for authoritative commerce data
- external stores or APIs for data owned outside VTEX

If the app stores a local copy, keep it small, derived, and clearly secondary to the authoritative source.

## Common failure modes

- Using app settings as generic storage for records, histories, or large lists.
- Mirroring complete orders, products, or prices from VTEX core into Master Data or VBase as a parallel source of truth.
- Fetching entire datasets only to filter, sort, or aggregate them in memory for normal request flows.
- Using Master Data or VBase for unbounded debug logs or event dumps.
- Adding caches without clear freshness, invalidation, or ownership rules.
- Spreading ad hoc data access decisions across handlers instead of keeping source-of-truth and storage decisions explicit.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is this data truly configuration, or should it live in Master Data, VBase, a core API, or an external system?
- [ ] Is the authoritative source of truth explicit?
- [ ] Is VTEX core being treated as authoritative for orders, catalog, prices, inventory, and similar domains?
- [ ] Is local storage limited to data the app truly owns or a narrow derived view?
- [ ] Are reads bounded with filters, field selection, and pagination where appropriate?
- [ ] Does any cache or local copy have clear freshness and invalidation rules?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when designing or implementing asynchronous processing in vtex io services through events, workers, and background handlers. covers event handler structure, idempotency, retry-safe processing, and moving expensive work out of request-response routes. use for event-driven integrations, delayed processing, or background jobs in vtex io apps.

# Events, Workers & Async Processing

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when a VTEX IO app needs to process work asynchronously through events, workers, or other background execution patterns.

- Consuming broadcasted events from other VTEX services
- Running background work that should not block HTTP responses
- Designing retry-safe handlers
- Processing batches or delayed jobs
- Building async integrations with external services

Do not use this skill for:
- defining HTTP route contracts
- designing GraphQL schemas or resolvers
- deciding app-level policies
- low-level client construction

## Decision rules

- Use events or workers when the work is expensive, retry-prone, or not required to complete inside a request-response cycle.
- VTEX uses an internal event broadcaster to deliver platform and app events to your service. The same broadcaster can route events published by your app to other handlers. Assume at-least-once delivery semantics in both directions: events can be retried or replayed, so handlers must be idempotent and safe under duplicates.
- Keep event handlers idempotent. The same event may be delivered more than once, so handlers must tolerate replay safely.
- Persist idempotency and processing state in an appropriate store, such as VBase for keyed markers or Master Data for structured records, so handlers can detect duplicates, completed work, and failures across retries.
- Declare events and workers explicitly in `service.json` so they are wired into the IO runtime, and keep their input contracts stable and explicit instead of relying on HTTP route assumptions.
- When you need to notify other apps or fan out work, publish events through the appropriate VTEX IO client or event mechanism instead of creating ad hoc HTTP callbacks just to simulate asynchronous delivery.
- To publish events through the VTEX IO event bus, apps often need the `colossus-fire-event` policy in `manifest.json`. Add other policies only when the app actually consumes those protected resources as well.
- Separate event ingestion from business orchestration when a handler grows beyond a small, clear unit of work.
- Treat retries as expected behavior, not exceptional behavior. Design handlers so repeated execution is safe.
- Keep background handlers explicit about side effects such as writes, external calls, or status transitions.
- For batch-oriented handlers, process items in small, explicit units and record status per item so that a single failing element does not hide progress on the rest of the batch.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Event handlers must be idempotent

Every event or background handler MUST tolerate duplicate execution without creating inconsistent side effects.

**Why this matters**

Async systems retry. Without idempotency, duplicate deliveries can create duplicated records, repeated partner calls, or invalid state transitions.

**Detection**

If the handler performs writes or external side effects without checking whether the work was already completed, STOP and add idempotency protection before proceeding.

**Correct**

```typescript
export async function handleOrderCreated(ctx: Context) {
  const { orderId } = ctx.body
  const alreadyProcessed = await ctx.clients.statusStore.hasProcessed(orderId)

  if (alreadyProcessed) {
    return
  }

  await ctx.clients.partnerApi.sendOrder(orderId)
  await ctx.clients.statusStore.markProcessed(orderId)
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
export async function handleOrderCreated(ctx: Context) {
  await ctx.clients.partnerApi.sendOrder(ctx.body.orderId)
}
```

### Constraint: Background work must not rely on request-only assumptions

Workers and event handlers MUST not depend on HTTP-only assumptions such as route params, immediate user interaction, or request-bound mutable state.

**Why this matters**

Async handlers run outside the route lifecycle. Reusing HTTP assumptions leads to missing context, brittle behavior, and accidental coupling between sync and async paths.

**Detection**

If an event handler expects request headers, route params, or a route-specific state shape, STOP and redesign the input contract so the handler receives explicit async data.

**Correct**

```typescript
export async function handleImport(ctx: Context) {
  const { importId, account } = ctx.body
  await ctx.clients.importApi.process(importId, account)
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
export async function handleImport(ctx: Context) {
  await ctx.clients.importApi.process(ctx.vtex.route.params.id, ctx.request.header.account)
}
```

### Constraint: Expensive async flows must surface partial failure clearly

Async handlers MUST make partial failures visible through state, logs, or durable markers instead of silently swallowing them.

**Why this matters**

Background failures are harder to see than route failures. Without explicit failure signaling, operations teams cannot tell whether work was skipped, retried, or partially completed.

**Detection**

If the handler catches errors without recording failure state, logging enough context, or rethrowing when appropriate, STOP and make failure handling explicit.

**Correct**

```typescript
export async function handleSync(ctx: Context) {
  try {
    await ctx.clients.partnerApi.syncCatalog(ctx.body.catalogId)
    await ctx.clients.statusStore.markSuccess(ctx.body.catalogId)
  } catch (error) {
    await ctx.clients.statusStore.markFailure(ctx.body.catalogId)
    throw error
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
export async function handleSync(ctx: Context) {
  try {
    await ctx.clients.partnerApi.syncCatalog(ctx.body.catalogId)
  } catch (_) {
    return
  }
}
```

## Preferred pattern

Recommended file layout:

```text
node/
├── events/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── catalog.ts
│   └── orders.ts
└── workers/
    └── sync.ts
```

Minimal async handler pattern:

```typescript
export async function handleCatalogChanged(ctx: Context) {
  const { skuId } = ctx.body
  const alreadyDone = await ctx.clients.syncState.isProcessed(skuId)

  if (alreadyDone) {
    return
  }

  await ctx.clients.catalogSync.syncSku(skuId)
  await ctx.clients.syncState.markProcessed(skuId)
}
```

Illustrative event publishing pattern:

```typescript
export async function broadcast(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const {
    clients: { events },
    body: { payload, senderAppId, clientAppId },
  } = ctx

  for (const row of payload as unknown[]) {
    await events.sendEvent(clientAppId, 'my-app.event-name', {
      data: row,
      senderAppId,
    })
  }

  await next()
}
```

Minimal manifest policy for event publishing:

```json
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "colossus-fire-event"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use routes to acknowledge or trigger work, and use events or workers to perform slow, repeatable, and failure-aware processing.

Use storage intentionally for async state:

- VBase for simple idempotency markers keyed by an external identifier
- Master Data for structured processing records with status and timestamps

Treat the async payload as its own contract instead of reusing route-only assumptions from an HTTP request.

For fan-out or cross-app notifications, publish a small, well-defined event containing IDs and minimal metadata, then let downstream handlers fetch full details from the source of truth when needed instead of embedding large payloads or relying on custom callback URLs.

In development, use the Broadcaster app's `Notify Target Workspace` setting in Admin to route events to a specific workspace instead of inventing ad hoc public routes or test-only delivery flows. Handlers should still behave correctly regardless of which workspace receives the event.

## Common failure modes

- Treating event delivery as exactly-once instead of at-least-once.
- Reusing HTTP route assumptions inside workers or event handlers.
- Swallowing background errors without explicit failure state.
- Letting one event handler orchestrate too many unrelated side effects.
- Performing expensive work synchronously in routes instead of moving it to async processing.
- Logging full event payloads with secrets or tokens instead of using IDs and metadata for correlation.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is async processing the right mechanism for this work?
- [ ] Is the handler idempotent under duplicate delivery?
- [ ] Is idempotency or processing state stored in an appropriate backend such as VBase or Master Data?
- [ ] Are events and workers declared explicitly in `service.json`?
- [ ] Are background inputs explicit and independent from HTTP route assumptions?
- [ ] Are failures surfaced clearly enough for retry and troubleshooting?
- [ ] For batch processing, is status visible per item or per small unit of work?
- [ ] Should large handlers be split into smaller async units or orchestration steps?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when working with graphql schema files in graphql/ or implementing resolvers in node/resolvers/ for vtex io apps. covers schema.graphql definitions, @cachecontrol and @auth directives, custom type definitions, and resolver registration in the service class. use for exposing data through graphql queries and mutations with proper cache control and authentication enforcement.

# GraphQL Schemas & Resolvers

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when your VTEX IO app needs to expose a GraphQL API — either for frontend React components to query, for other VTEX IO apps to consume, or for implementing custom data aggregation layers over VTEX Commerce APIs.

- Defining schemas in `.graphql` files in the `/graphql` directory
- Writing resolver functions in TypeScript in `/node/resolvers/`
- Configuring `@cacheControl` and `@auth` directives
- Wiring resolvers into the Service class

Do not use this skill for:
- Backend service structure and client system (use `vtex-io-service-apps` instead)
- Manifest and builder configuration (use `vtex-io-app-structure` instead)
- MasterData integration details (use `vtex-io-masterdata` instead)

## Decision rules

- The `graphql` builder processes `.graphql` files in `/graphql` and merges them into a single schema.
- Split definitions across multiple files for maintainability: `schema.graphql` for root types, `directives.graphql` for directive declarations, `types/*.graphql` for custom types.
- Use `@cacheControl(scope: PUBLIC, maxAge: SHORT|MEDIUM|LONG)` on all public Query fields. `PUBLIC` = shared CDN cache, `PRIVATE` = per-user cache.
- Use `@auth` on all Mutations and on Queries that return sensitive or user-specific data.
- Never use `@cacheControl` on Mutations.
- Resolver function keys in the Service entry point MUST exactly match the field names in `schema.graphql`.
- Always use `ctx.clients` in resolvers for data access — never raw HTTP calls.

Recommended directory structure:

```text
graphql/
├── schema.graphql        # Query and Mutation root type definitions
├── directives.graphql    # Custom directive declarations (@cacheControl, @auth)
└── types/
    ├── Review.graphql    # Custom type definitions
    └── Product.graphql   # One file per type for organization
```

Built-in directives:
- **`@cacheControl`**: `scope` (`PUBLIC`/`PRIVATE`), `maxAge` (`SHORT` 30s, `MEDIUM` 5min, `LONG` 1h)
- **`@auth`**: Enforces valid VTEX authentication token. Without it, unauthenticated users can call the endpoint.
- **`@smartcache`**: Automatically caches query results in VTEX infrastructure.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Declare the graphql Builder

Any app using `.graphql` schema files MUST declare the `graphql` builder in `manifest.json`. The `graphql` builder interprets the schema and registers it with the VTEX IO runtime.

**Why this matters**

Without the `graphql` builder declaration, the `/graphql` directory is completely ignored. Schema files will not be processed, resolvers will not be registered, and GraphQL queries will return "schema not found" errors. The app will link without errors but GraphQL will silently not work.

**Detection**

If you see `.graphql` files in a `/graphql` directory but the manifest does not include `"graphql": "1.x"` in `builders`, STOP and add the builder declaration.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x",
    "graphql": "1.x"
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x"
  }
}
```

Missing `"graphql": "1.x"` — the `/graphql` directory with schema files is ignored. GraphQL queries return errors because no schema is registered. The app links successfully, masking the problem.

---

### Constraint: Use @cacheControl on Public Queries

All public-facing Query fields (those fetching data that is not user-specific) MUST include the `@cacheControl` directive with an appropriate `scope` and `maxAge`. Mutations MUST NOT use `@cacheControl`.

**Why this matters**

Without `@cacheControl`, every query hits your resolver on every request — no CDN caching, no edge caching, no shared caching. This leads to unnecessary load on VTEX infrastructure, slow response times, and potential rate limiting. For public product data, caching is critical for performance.

**Detection**

If a Query field returns public data (not user-specific) and does not have `@cacheControl`, warn the developer to add it. If a Mutation has `@cacheControl`, STOP and remove it.

**Correct**

```graphql
type Query {
  reviews(productId: String!, limit: Int): [Review]
    @cacheControl(scope: PUBLIC, maxAge: SHORT)

  productMetadata(slug: String!): ProductMetadata
    @cacheControl(scope: PUBLIC, maxAge: MEDIUM)

  myReviews: [Review]
    @cacheControl(scope: PRIVATE, maxAge: SHORT)
    @auth
}

type Mutation {
  createReview(review: ReviewInput!): Review @auth
}
```

**Wrong**

```graphql
type Query {
  reviews(productId: String!, limit: Int): [Review]

  myReviews: [Review]
}

type Mutation {
  createReview(review: ReviewInput!): Review
    @cacheControl(scope: PUBLIC, maxAge: LONG)
}
```

No cache control on queries (every request hits the resolver), missing `@auth` on user-specific data, and `@cacheControl` on a mutation (makes no sense).

---

### Constraint: Resolver Names Must Match Schema Fields

Resolver function keys in the Service entry point MUST exactly match the field names defined in `schema.graphql`. The resolver object structure must mirror the GraphQL type hierarchy.

**Why this matters**

The GraphQL runtime maps incoming queries to resolver functions by name. If the resolver key does not match the schema field name, the field will resolve to `null` without any error — a silent failure that is extremely difficult to debug.

**Detection**

If a schema field has no matching resolver key (or vice versa), STOP. Cross-check every Query and Mutation field against the resolver registration in `node/index.ts`.

**Correct**

```graphql
type Query {
  reviews(productId: String!): [Review]
  reviewById(id: ID!): Review
}
```

```typescript
// node/index.ts — resolver keys match schema field names exactly
export default new Service({
  graphql: {
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        reviews: reviewsResolver,
        reviewById: reviewByIdResolver,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
// node/index.ts — resolver key "getReviews" does not match schema field "reviews"
export default new Service({
  graphql: {
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        getReviews: reviewsResolver,    // Wrong! Schema says "reviews", not "getReviews"
        getReviewById: reviewByIdResolver, // Wrong! Schema says "reviewById"
      },
    },
  },
})
```

Both fields will silently resolve to null. No error in logs.

## Preferred pattern

Add the GraphQL builder to manifest:

```json
{
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x",
    "graphql": "1.x"
  }
}
```

Define the schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  reviews(productId: String!, limit: Int, offset: Int): ReviewsResponse
    @cacheControl(scope: PUBLIC, maxAge: SHORT)

  review(id: ID!): Review
    @cacheControl(scope: PUBLIC, maxAge: SHORT)
}

type Mutation {
  createReview(input: ReviewInput!): Review @auth
  updateReview(id: ID!, input: ReviewInput!): Review @auth
  deleteReview(id: ID!): Boolean @auth
}
```

Define custom types:

```graphql
type Review {
  id: ID!
  productId: String!
  author: String!
  rating: Int!
  title: String!
  text: String!
  createdAt: String!
  approved: Boolean!
}

type ReviewsResponse {
  data: [Review!]!
  total: Int!
  hasMore: Boolean!
}

input ReviewInput {
  productId: String!
  rating: Int!
  title: String!
  text: String!
}
```

Declare directives:

```graphql
directive @cacheControl(
  scope: CacheControlScope
  maxAge: CacheControlMaxAge
) on FIELD_DEFINITION

enum CacheControlScope {
  PUBLIC
  PRIVATE
}

enum CacheControlMaxAge {
  SHORT
  MEDIUM
  LONG
}

directive @auth on FIELD_DEFINITION
directive @smartcache on FIELD_DEFINITION
```

Implement resolvers:

```typescript
// node/resolvers/reviews.ts
import type { ServiceContext } from '@vtex/api'
import type { Clients } from '../clients'

type Context = ServiceContext<Clients>

export const queries = {
  reviews: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: { productId: string; limit?: number; offset?: number },
    ctx: Context
  ) => {
    const { productId, limit = 10, offset = 0 } = args
    const reviews = await ctx.clients.masterdata.searchDocuments<Review>({
      dataEntity: 'reviews',
      fields: ['id', 'productId', 'author', 'rating', 'title', 'text', 'createdAt', 'approved'],
      where: `productId=${productId} AND approved=true`,
      pagination: { page: Math.floor(offset / limit) + 1, pageSize: limit },
      schema: 'review-schema-v1',
    })

    return {
      data: reviews,
      total: reviews.length,
      hasMore: reviews.length === limit,
    }
  },

  review: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: { id: string },
    ctx: Context
  ) => {
    return ctx.clients.masterdata.getDocument<Review>({
      dataEntity: 'reviews',
      id: args.id,
      fields: ['id', 'productId', 'author', 'rating', 'title', 'text', 'createdAt', 'approved'],
    })
  },
}

export const mutations = {
  createReview: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: { input: ReviewInput },
    ctx: Context
  ) => {
    const { input } = args

    const documentResponse = await ctx.clients.masterdata.createDocument({
      dataEntity: 'reviews',
      fields: {
        ...input,
        author: ctx.vtex.storeUserEmail ?? 'anonymous',
        approved: false,
        createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      },
      schema: 'review-schema-v1',
    })

    return ctx.clients.masterdata.getDocument<Review>({
      dataEntity: 'reviews',
      id: documentResponse.DocumentId,
      fields: ['id', 'productId', 'author', 'rating', 'title', 'text', 'createdAt', 'approved'],
    })
  },

  deleteReview: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: { id: string },
    ctx: Context
  ) => {
    await ctx.clients.masterdata.deleteDocument({
      dataEntity: 'reviews',
      id: args.id,
    })

    return true
  },
}
```

Wire resolvers into the Service:

```typescript
// node/index.ts
import type { ParamsContext, RecorderState } from '@vtex/api'
import { Service } from '@vtex/api'

import { Clients } from './clients'
import { queries, mutations } from './resolvers/reviews'

export default new Service<Clients, RecorderState, ParamsContext>({
  clients: {
    implementation: Clients,
    options: {
      default: {
        retries: 2,
        timeout: 5000,
      },
    },
  },
  graphql: {
    resolvers: {
      Query: queries,
      Mutation: mutations,
    },
  },
})
```

Testing the GraphQL API after linking:

```graphql
query GetReviews {
  reviews(productId: "12345", limit: 5) {
    data {
      id
      author
      rating
      title
      text
      createdAt
    }
    total
    hasMore
  }
}

mutation CreateReview {
  createReview(input: {
    productId: "12345"
    rating: 5
    title: "Excellent product"
    text: "Really happy with this purchase."
  }) {
    id
    author
    createdAt
  }
}
```

## Common failure modes

- **Defining resolvers without matching schema fields**: The GraphQL runtime only exposes fields defined in the schema. Resolvers without matching fields are silently ignored. Conversely, schema fields without resolvers return `null`. Always define the schema first, then implement matching resolvers with identical names.
- **Querying external APIs directly in resolvers**: Using `fetch()` or `axios` bypasses the `@vtex/api` client system, losing caching, retries, metrics, and authentication. Always use `ctx.clients` in resolvers.
- **Missing @auth on mutation endpoints**: Without `@auth`, any anonymous user can call the mutation — a critical security vulnerability. Always add `@auth` to mutations and queries returning sensitive data.
- **Missing @cacheControl on public queries**: Every request hits the resolver without caching, causing unnecessary load and slow responses. Add appropriate cache directives to all public Query fields.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is the `graphql` builder declared in `manifest.json`?
- [ ] Do all public Query fields have `@cacheControl` with appropriate scope and maxAge?
- [ ] Do all Mutations and sensitive Queries have `@auth`?
- [ ] Do resolver function keys exactly match schema field names?
- [ ] Are resolvers using `ctx.clients` for data access (no raw HTTP calls)?
- [ ] Are directive declarations present in `directives.graphql`?
- [ ] Is the resolver wired into the Service entry point under `graphql.resolvers`?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when designing or implementing http endpoints exposed by a vtex io backend service. covers route boundaries, handler structure, middleware composition, request validation, and response modeling for service.json routes. use for webhook endpoints, partner integrations, callback apis, or reviewing vtex io handlers that should expose explicit http contracts.

# HTTP Routes & Handler Boundaries

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when a VTEX IO service needs to expose explicit HTTP endpoints through `service.json` routes and implement the corresponding handlers under `node/`.

- Building callback or webhook endpoints
- Exposing integration endpoints for partners or backoffice flows
- Structuring route handlers and middleware chains
- Validating params, query strings, headers, or request bodies
- Standardizing response shape and status code behavior

Do not use this skill for:
- sizing or tuning the service runtime
- deciding app policies in `manifest.json`
- designing GraphQL APIs
- modeling async event or worker flows

## Decision rules

- Use HTTP routes when the integration needs explicit URL contracts, webhooks, or callback-style request-response behavior.
- In VTEX IO, `service.json` declares route IDs, paths, and exposure such as `public`, while the Node entrypoint wires those route IDs to handlers exported from `node/routes`. Middlewares are composed in code, not declared directly in `service.json`.
- Keep route handlers small and explicit. Route code should validate input, call domain or integration services, and shape the response.
- Put cross-cutting concerns such as validation, request normalization, or shared auth checks into middlewares instead of duplicating them across handlers.
- Define route params, query expectations, and body shape as close as possible to the handler boundary.
- Use consistent status codes and response structures for similar route families.
- For webhook or callback endpoints, follow the caller's documented expectations for status codes and error bodies, and keep responses small and deterministic to avoid ambiguous retries.
- Emit structured logs or metrics for critical routes so failures, latency, and integration health can be diagnosed without changing the handler contract.
- Prefer explicit route files grouped by bounded domain such as `routes/orders.ts` or `routes/catalog.ts`.
- Treat public routes as explicit external contracts. Do not expand a route to public use without reviewing validation, auth expectations, and response safety.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Route handlers must keep the HTTP contract explicit

Each route handler MUST make the request and response contract understandable at the handler boundary. Do not hide required params, body fields, or status code decisions deep inside unrelated services.

**Why this matters**

HTTP integrations depend on predictable contracts. When validation and response shaping are implicit or scattered, partner integrations become fragile and errors become harder to diagnose.

**Detection**

If the handler delegates immediately without validating required params, query values, headers, or request body shape, STOP and make the contract explicit before proceeding.

**Correct**

```typescript
export async function getOrder(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const { id } = ctx.vtex.route.params

  if (!id) {
    ctx.status = 400
    ctx.body = { message: 'Missing route param: id' }
    return
  }

  const order = await ctx.clients.partnerApi.getOrder(id)
  ctx.status = 200
  ctx.body = order
  await next()
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
export async function getOrder(ctx: Context) {
  ctx.body = await handleOrder(ctx)
}
```

### Constraint: Shared route concerns must live in middlewares, not repeated in every handler

Repeated concerns such as validation, request normalization, or common auth checks SHOULD be implemented as middlewares and composed through the route chain.

**Why this matters**

Duplicating the same checks in many handlers creates drift and inconsistent route behavior. Middleware keeps the HTTP surface easier to review and evolve.

**Detection**

If multiple handlers repeat the same body validation, header checks, or context preparation, STOP and extract a middleware before adding more duplication.

**Correct**

```typescript
export async function validateSignature(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const signature = ctx.request.header['x-signature']

  if (!signature) {
    ctx.status = 401
    ctx.body = { message: 'Missing signature' }
    return
  }

  await next()
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
export async function routeA(ctx: Context) {
  if (!ctx.request.header['x-signature']) {
    ctx.status = 401
    return
  }
}

export async function routeB(ctx: Context) {
  if (!ctx.request.header['x-signature']) {
    ctx.status = 401
    return
  }
}
```

### Constraint: HTTP routes should not absorb async or batch work that belongs in events or workers

Routes MUST keep request-response latency bounded. If a route triggers expensive, retry-prone, or batch-oriented work, move that work to an async flow and keep the route as a thin trigger or acknowledgment boundary.

**Why this matters**

Long-running HTTP handlers create poor integration behavior, timeout risk, and operational instability. VTEX IO services should separate immediate route contracts from background processing.

**Detection**

If a route performs large loops, batch imports, heavy retries, or work that is not required to complete before responding, STOP and redesign the flow around async processing.

**Correct**

```typescript
export async function triggerImport(ctx: Context) {
  await ctx.clients.importApi.enqueueImport(ctx.request.body)
  ctx.status = 202
  ctx.body = { accepted: true }
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
export async function triggerImport(ctx: Context) {
  for (const item of ctx.request.body.items) {
    await ctx.clients.importApi.importItem(item)
  }

  ctx.status = 200
}
```

## Preferred pattern

Recommended file layout:

```text
node/
├── routes/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── orders.ts
│   └── webhooks.ts
└── middlewares/
    ├── validateBody.ts
    └── validateSignature.ts
```

Wiring routes in VTEX IO services:

In VTEX IO, `service.json` declares route IDs and paths, the Node entrypoint registers a `routes` object in `new Service(...)`, and `node/routes/index.ts` maps each route ID to the final handler. Middlewares are composed in code, not declared directly in `service.json`.

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "orders-get": {
      "path": "/_v/orders/:id",
      "public": false
    },
    "reviews-create": {
      "path": "/_v/reviews",
      "public": false
    }
  }
}
```

```typescript
// node/index.ts
import type { ClientsConfig, RecorderState, ServiceContext } from '@vtex/api'
import { Service } from '@vtex/api'
import { Clients } from './clients'
import routes from './routes'

const clients: ClientsConfig<Clients> = {
  implementation: Clients,
  options: {
    default: {
      retries: 2,
      timeout: 800,
    },
  },
}

declare global {
  type Context = ServiceContext<Clients, RecorderState>
}

export default new Service<Clients, RecorderState>({
  clients,
  routes,
})
```

Minimal route pattern:

```typescript
// node/routes/index.ts
import type { RouteHandler } from '@vtex/api'
import { createReview } from './reviews'
import { getOrder } from './orders'

const routes: Record<string, RouteHandler> = {
  'orders-get': getOrder,
  'reviews-create': createReview,
}

export default routes
```

```typescript
// node/routes/orders.ts
import { compose } from 'koa-compose'
import { validateSignature } from '../middlewares/validateSignature'

async function rawGetOrder(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const { id } = ctx.vtex.route.params

  if (!id) {
    ctx.status = 400
    ctx.body = { message: 'Missing route param: id' }
    return
  }

  const order = await ctx.clients.partnerApi.getOrder(id)
  ctx.status = 200
  ctx.body = order

  await next()
}

export const getOrder = compose([validateSignature, rawGetOrder])
```

```typescript
export async function createReview(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const body = ctx.request.body

  if (!body?.productId) {
    ctx.status = 400
    ctx.body = { message: 'Missing productId' }
    return
  }

  const review = await ctx.clients.reviewApi.createReview(body)
  ctx.status = 201
  ctx.body = review
  await next()
}
```

Keep domain logic in services or integrations, and keep route handlers responsible for HTTP concerns such as validation, status codes, headers, and response shape.

## Common failure modes

- Hiding request validation inside unrelated services instead of making route expectations explicit.
- Repeating the same auth or normalization logic in many handlers instead of using middleware.
- Letting HTTP handlers perform long-running async or batch work.
- Returning inconsistent status codes or response shapes for similar endpoints.
- Expanding a route to public exposure without reviewing its trust boundary.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is HTTP the right exposure mechanism for this contract?
- [ ] Are required params, headers, query values, and body fields validated at the route boundary?
- [ ] Are repeated concerns factored into middlewares?
- [ ] Does the handler stay small and focused on HTTP concerns?
- [ ] Should any part of the work move to async events or workers instead?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when working with masterdata v2 entities, schemas, or masterdataclient in vtex io apps, or when anyone designing or implementing a solution must scrutinize whether master data is the correct storage. the skill prompts hard questions: native catalog or other vtex stores, oms, or an external database may be better; do not default to md because it is convenient. covers json schema, crud, triggers, search and scroll, schema lifecycle, purchase-path avoidance, single source of truth, and bff handoffs. use for justified custom persistence while avoiding the 60-schema limit.

# MasterData v2 Integration

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when your VTEX IO app needs to store custom data (reviews, wishlists, form submissions, configuration records), query or filter that data, or set up automated workflows triggered by data changes—and when you must **justify** Master Data versus other VTEX or external stores.

- Defining data entities and JSON Schemas using the `masterdata` builder
- Performing CRUD operations through MasterDataClient (`ctx.clients.masterdata`)
- Configuring search, scroll, and indexing for efficient data retrieval
- Setting up Master Data triggers for automated workflows
- Managing schema lifecycle to avoid the 60-schema limit
- **Deciding** whether data belongs in **Catalog** (fields, **specifications**, unstructured SKU/product specs), **Master Data**, **native OMS/checkout** surfaces, or an **external** SQL/NoSQL/database
- Avoiding **synchronous** Master Data on the **purchase critical path** (cart, checkout, payment, placement) unless there is a **hard** performance and reliability case
- Preferring **one source of truth**—avoid **duplicating** order headers or OMS lists in Master Data for convenience; prefer **OMS** or a **BFF** with **caching** (see **Related skills**)

Do not use this skill for:

- General backend service patterns (use `vtex-io-service-apps` instead)
- GraphQL schema definitions (use `vtex-io-graphql-api` instead)
- Manifest and builder configuration (use `vtex-io-app-structure` instead)

## Decision rules

### Before you choose Master Data

Architects, developers, and anyone **designing or implementing** a solution should **think deeply** and **treat this section as a checklist to critique the default**: double-check that Master Data is the **right** persistence layer—not an automatic pick. The skill is written to **question** convenience-driven choices.

- **Purpose** — Master Data is a **document-oriented** store (similar in spirit to **document DBs** / DynamoDB-style access patterns). It is **one option** among many; choosing it because it is “there” or “cheap” without a **workload fit** review is a design smell.
- **Product-bound data** — If the information is fundamentally **about products or SKUs**, evaluate **Catalog** first: **specifications**, **unstructured product/SKU specifications**, and native catalog fields before creating a **parallel** MD entity that mirrors catalog truth.
- **Purchase path** — **Do not** place **synchronous** Master Data reads/writes in the **hot path** of **checkout** (cart mutation, payment, order placement) unless you have **evidence** (latency budget, failure modes). Prefer **native** commerce stores and **async** or **after-order** enrichment.
- **Orders and lists** — **Duplicating** **OMS** or **order** data into Master Data to power **My Orders** or similar **usually** fights **single source of truth**. Prefer **OMS APIs** (or **marketplace** protocols) behind a **BFF** or **IO** layer with **application caching** and correct **HTTP/path** semantics—not a second **order database** in MD “because it is easier.”
- **Exposing MD** — Master Data is **storage** only. Any **storefront** or **partner** access should go through a **service** that enforces **authentication**, **authorization**, and **rate limits**—typically **VTEX IO** or an external **BFF** following [headless-bff-architecture](../../../headless/skills/headless-bff-architecture/skill.md) patterns.
- **When MD fits** — After **storage fit** review, if MD remains appropriate, implement CRUD and schema discipline as below; combine with [vtex-io-application-performance](../vtex-io-application-performance/skill.md) and [vtex-io-service-paths-and-cdn](../vtex-io-service-paths-and-cdn/skill.md) when exposing HTTP or GraphQL from IO.

### Entity governance and hygiene

Before creating a new entity or extending an existing one, understand the landscape:

- **Native entities** — The platform manages entities like `CL` (clients), `AD` (addresses), `OD` (orders), `BK` (bookmarks), `AU` (auth), and others. **Never** create custom entities that duplicate native entity purposes. Know which entities exist before adding new ones.
- **Entity usage audit** — In accounts with dozens of custom entities, classify each by purpose: **logs/monitoring**, **cache/temporary**, **order extension**, **customer extension**, **marketing**, **CMS/content**, **integration/sync**, **auth/identity**, **logistics/geo**, or **custom business logic**. Entities in the **logs** or **cache** categories often indicate misuse—IO app logs belong in the logger, not MD; caches belong in VBase, not MD.
- **Critical path flag** — Identify whether an entity is used in **checkout**, **cart**, **payment**, or **login** flows. Entities on the critical path must meet strict latency and availability requirements. If an MD entity is on the critical path, question whether it should be there at all.
- **Document count awareness** — Use `REST-Content-Range` headers from `GET /search?_fields=id` with `REST-Range: resources=0-0` to efficiently count documents without fetching them. Large entities (100k+ docs) need `scrollDocuments`, pagination strategy, and potentially a BFF caching layer.

### Bulk operations and data migration

When importing, exporting, or migrating large datasets:

- **Validate before import** — Cross-reference import data against the authoritative source (e.g. catalog export for SKU validation, CL entity or user management API for email allowlists). Produce exception reports for invalid rows before touching MD.
- **JSONL payloads** — Generate one JSON object per MD document in a `.jsonl` file for bulk imports. This enables resumable, line-by-line processing.
- **Rate limiting** — MD APIs enforce rate limits. Use configurable delays between calls (e.g. 400ms) with exponential backoff on HTTP 429 responses.
- **Checkpoints** — For large imports (10k+ documents), persist progress to a checkpoint file (last successful document ID or line index). On failure or timeout, resume from the checkpoint instead of restarting.
- **Parallel with bounded concurrency** — Use a concurrency pool (e.g. `p-queue` with concurrency 5-10) for parallel `POST` or `PATCH` operations. Too much parallelism triggers rate limits; too little is slow.
- **Bulk delete before re-import** — When replacing all documents in an entity, use scroll + delete before import, or implement a separate delete pass with the same checkpoint and backoff patterns.
- **Schema alignment** — Ensure import payloads match the entity's JSON Schema exactly. Missing required fields or type mismatches cause silent validation failures.

### Implementation rules

- A **data entity** is a named collection of documents (analogous to a database table). A **JSON Schema** defines structure, validation, and indexing.
- When using the `masterdata` builder, entities are defined by folder structure: `masterdata/{entityName}/schema.json`. The builder creates entities named `{vendor}_{appName}_{entityName}`.
- Use `ctx.clients.masterdata` or `masterDataFor` from `@vtex/clients` for all CRUD operations — never direct REST calls.
- All fields used in `where` clauses MUST be declared in the schema's `v-indexed` array for efficient querying.
- Use `searchDocuments` for bounded result sets (known small size, max page size 100). Use `scrollDocuments` for large/unbounded result sets.
- The `masterdata` builder creates a new schema per app version. Clean up unused schemas to avoid the 60-schema-per-entity hard limit.

MasterDataClient methods:

| Method                              | Description                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `getDocument`                       | Retrieve a single document by ID                     |
| `createDocument`                    | Create a new document, returns generated ID          |
| `createOrUpdateEntireDocument`      | Upsert a complete document                           |
| `createOrUpdatePartialDocument`     | Upsert partial fields (patch)                        |
| `updateEntireDocument`              | Replace all fields of an existing document           |
| `updatePartialDocument`             | Update specific fields only                          |
| `deleteDocument`                    | Delete a document by ID                              |
| `searchDocuments`                   | Search with filters, pagination, and field selection |
| `searchDocumentsWithPaginationInfo` | Search with total count metadata                     |
| `scrollDocuments`                   | Iterate over large result sets                       |

Search `where` clause syntax:

```text
where: "productId=12345 AND approved=true"
where: "rating>3"
where: "createdAt between 2025-01-01 AND 2025-12-31"
```

```

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Use MasterDataClient — Never Direct REST Calls

All Master Data operations in VTEX IO apps MUST go through the MasterDataClient (`ctx.clients.masterdata`) or the `masterDataFor` factory from `@vtex/clients`. You MUST NOT make direct REST calls to `/api/dataentities/` endpoints.

**Why this matters**

The MasterDataClient handles authentication token injection, request routing, retry logic, caching, and proper error handling. Direct REST calls bypass all of these, requiring manual auth headers, pagination, and retry logic. When the VTEX auth token format changes, direct calls break while the client handles it transparently.

**Detection**

If you see direct HTTP calls to URLs matching `/api/dataentities/`, `api.vtex.com/api/dataentities`, or raw fetch/axios calls targeting Master Data endpoints, warn the developer to use `ctx.clients.masterdata` instead.

**Correct**

```typescript
// Using MasterDataClient through ctx.clients
export async function getReview(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const { id } = ctx.query;

  const review = await ctx.clients.masterdata.getDocument<Review>({
    dataEntity: "reviews",
    id: id as string,
    fields: [
      "id",
      "productId",
      "author",
      "rating",
      "title",
      "text",
      "approved",
    ],
  });

  ctx.status = 200;
  ctx.body = review;
  await next();
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
// Direct REST call to Master Data — bypasses client infrastructure
import axios from "axios";

export async function getReview(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const { id } = ctx.query;

  // No caching, no retry, no proper auth, no metrics
  const response = await axios.get(
    `https://api.vtex.com/api/dataentities/reviews/documents/${id}`,
    {
      headers: {
        "X-VTEX-API-AppKey": process.env.VTEX_APP_KEY,
        "X-VTEX-API-AppToken": process.env.VTEX_APP_TOKEN,
      },
    },
  );

  ctx.status = 200;
  ctx.body = response.data;
  await next();
}
```

---

### Constraint: Define JSON Schemas for All Data Entities

Every data entity your app uses MUST have a corresponding JSON Schema, either via the `masterdata` builder (recommended) or created via the Master Data API before the app is deployed.

**Why this matters**

Without a schema, Master Data stores documents as unstructured JSON. This means no field validation, no indexing (making search extremely slow on large datasets), no type safety, and no trigger support. Queries on unindexed fields perform full scans, which can time out or hit rate limits.

**Detection**

If the app creates or searches documents in a data entity but no JSON Schema exists for that entity (either in the `masterdata/` builder directory or via API), warn the developer to define a schema.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
  "title": "review-schema-v1",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "productId": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "author": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "rating": {
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 1,
      "maximum": 5
    },
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 200
    },
    "text": {
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 5000
    },
    "approved": {
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    "createdAt": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time"
    }
  },
  "required": ["productId", "rating", "title", "text"],
  "v-default-fields": [
    "productId",
    "author",
    "rating",
    "title",
    "approved",
    "createdAt"
  ],
  "v-indexed": ["productId", "author", "approved", "rating", "createdAt"]
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
// Saving documents without any schema — no validation, no indexing
await ctx.clients.masterdata.createDocument({
  dataEntity: "reviews",
  fields: {
    productId: "12345",
    rating: "five", // String instead of number — no validation!
    title: 123, // Number instead of string — no validation!
  },
});

// Searching on unindexed fields — full table scan, will time out on large datasets
await ctx.clients.masterdata.searchDocuments({
  dataEntity: "reviews",
  where: "productId=12345", // productId is not indexed — very slow
  fields: ["id", "rating"],
  pagination: { page: 1, pageSize: 10 },
});
```

### Constraint: Manage Schema Versions to Avoid the 60-Schema Limit

Master Data v2 data entities have a limit of 60 schemas per entity. When using the `masterdata` builder, each app version linked or installed creates a new schema. You MUST delete unused schemas regularly.

**Why this matters**

Once the 60-schema limit is reached, the `masterdata` builder cannot create new schemas, and linking or installing new app versions will fail. This is a hard platform limit that cannot be increased.

**Detection**

If the app has been through many link/install cycles, warn the developer to check and clean up old schemas using the Delete Schema API.

**Correct**

```bash
# Periodically clean up unused schemas
# List schemas for the entity
curl -X GET "https://{account}.vtexcommercestable.com.br/api/dataentities/reviews/schemas" \
  -H "X-VTEX-API-AppKey: {appKey}" \
  -H "X-VTEX-API-AppToken: {appToken}"

# Delete old schemas that are no longer in use
curl -X DELETE "https://{account}.vtexcommercestable.com.br/api/dataentities/reviews/schemas/old-schema-name" \
  -H "X-VTEX-API-AppKey: {appKey}" \
  -H "X-VTEX-API-AppToken: {appToken}"
```

**Wrong**

```text
Never cleaning up schemas during development.
After 60 link cycles, the builder fails:
"Error: Maximum number of schemas reached for entity 'reviews'"
The app cannot be linked or installed until old schemas are deleted.
```

### Constraint: Do not use Master Data as a log, cache, or temporary store

Entities used for application **logging**, **caching** (IO app state, query results), or **temporary staging** data do not belong in Master Data. Use `ctx.vtex.logger` for logs, **VBase** for app-specific caches and temp state, and external log aggregation for audit trails.

**Why this matters** — Log and cache entities accumulate millions of documents, hit rate limits, make the entity unusable for legitimate queries, and waste storage. MD is not designed for high-write, high-volume, disposable data.

**Detection** — Entities with names like `LOG`, `cache`, `temp`, `staging`, `debug`, or entities whose document count grows unboundedly with traffic volume rather than business events.

**Correct**

```typescript
// Logs: use structured logger
ctx.vtex.logger.info({ action: 'priceUpdate', skuId, newPrice })

// Cache: use VBase
await ctx.clients.vbase.saveJSON('my-cache', cacheKey, data)
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
// Using MD as a log store — creates millions of documents
await ctx.clients.masterdata.createDocument({
  dataEntity: 'appLogs',
  fields: { level: 'info', message: `Price updated for ${skuId}`, timestamp: new Date() },
})
```

### Constraint: Do not create a parallel source of truth in Master Data without justification

Using Master Data to **mirror** data that already has a **system of record** in **OMS**, **Catalog**, or an **external ERP**—for example **order headers** for a custom list view, or **SKU attributes** that belong in **catalog specifications**—creates **drift**, **reconciliation** cost, and **incident** risk.

**Why this matters**

Two sources of truth disagree after partial failures, retries, or manual edits. Teams spend capacity syncing and debugging instead of **customer outcomes**.

**Detection**

New MD entities whose fields **duplicate** OMS order fields “for performance” without a **BFF cache** plan; **product** attributes stored in MD when **Catalog** specs would suffice; **scheduled jobs** to “fix” MD from OMS because they diverged.

**Correct**

```text
1. Identify the authoritative system (OMS, Catalog, partner API).
2. Read from that source via BFF or IO, with caching (application + HTTP semantics) as needed.
3. Use MD only for data without a native home or after explicit architecture sign-off.
```

**Wrong**

```text
"We store order snapshots in MD so the storefront is faster" while OMS remains canonical
and no reconciliation strategy exists — eventual inconsistency is guaranteed.
```

## Preferred pattern

Add the masterdata builder and policies:

```json
{
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x",
    "graphql": "1.x",
    "masterdata": "1.x"
  },
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "outbound-access",
      "attrs": {
        "host": "api.vtex.com",
        "path": "/api/*"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "ADMIN_DS"
    }
  ]
}
```

Define data entity schemas:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
  "title": "review-schema-v1",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "productId": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "author": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "email": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "email"
    },
    "rating": {
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 1,
      "maximum": 5
    },
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 200
    },
    "text": {
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 5000
    },
    "approved": {
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    "createdAt": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time"
    }
  },
  "required": ["productId", "rating", "title", "text"],
  "v-default-fields": [
    "productId",
    "author",
    "rating",
    "title",
    "approved",
    "createdAt"
  ],
  "v-indexed": ["productId", "author", "approved", "rating", "createdAt"],
  "v-cache": false
}
```

Set up the client with `masterDataFor`:

```typescript
// node/clients/index.ts
import { IOClients } from "@vtex/api";
import { masterDataFor } from "@vtex/clients";

interface Review {
  id: string;
  productId: string;
  author: string;
  email: string;
  rating: number;
  title: string;
  text: string;
  approved: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
}

export class Clients extends IOClients {
  public get reviews() {
    return this.getOrSet("reviews", masterDataFor<Review>("reviews"));
  }
}
```

Implement CRUD operations:

```typescript
// node/resolvers/reviews.ts
import type { ServiceContext } from "@vtex/api";
import type { Clients } from "../clients";

type Context = ServiceContext<Clients>;

export const queries = {
  reviews: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: { productId: string; page?: number; pageSize?: number },
    ctx: Context,
  ) => {
    const { productId, page = 1, pageSize = 10 } = args;

    const results = await ctx.clients.reviews.search(
      { page, pageSize },
      [
        "id",
        "productId",
        "author",
        "rating",
        "title",
        "text",
        "createdAt",
        "approved",
      ],
      "", // sort
      `productId=${productId} AND approved=true`,
    );

    return results;
  },
};

export const mutations = {
  createReview: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: {
      input: { productId: string; rating: number; title: string; text: string };
    },
    ctx: Context,
  ) => {
    const { input } = args;
    const email = ctx.vtex.storeUserEmail ?? "anonymous@store.com";

    const response = await ctx.clients.reviews.save({
      ...input,
      author: email.split("@")[0],
      email,
      approved: false,
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    });

    return ctx.clients.reviews.get(response.DocumentId, [
      "id",
      "productId",
      "author",
      "rating",
      "title",
      "text",
      "createdAt",
      "approved",
    ]);
  },

  deleteReview: async (_root: unknown, args: { id: string }, ctx: Context) => {
    await ctx.clients.reviews.delete(args.id);
    return true;
  },
};
```

Configure triggers (optional):

```json
{
  "name": "notify-moderator-on-new-review",
  "active": true,
  "condition": "approved=false",
  "action": {
    "type": "email",
    "provider": "default",
    "subject": "New review pending moderation",
    "to": ["moderator@mystore.com"],
    "body": "A new review has been submitted for product {{productId}} by {{author}}."
  },
  "retry": {
    "times": 3,
    "delay": { "addMinutes": 5 }
  }
}
```

Wire into Service:

```typescript
// node/index.ts
import type { ParamsContext, RecorderState } from "@vtex/api";
import { Service } from "@vtex/api";

import { Clients } from "./clients";
import { queries, mutations } from "./resolvers/reviews";

export default new Service<Clients, RecorderState, ParamsContext>({
  clients: {
    implementation: Clients,
    options: {
      default: {
        retries: 2,
        timeout: 5000,
      },
    },
  },
  graphql: {
    resolvers: {
      Query: queries,
      Mutation: mutations,
    },
  },
});
```

## Common failure modes

- **Direct REST calls to /api/dataentities/**: Using `axios` or `fetch` to call Master Data endpoints bypasses the client infrastructure — no auth, no caching, no retries. Use `ctx.clients.masterdata` or `masterDataFor` instead.
- **Searching without indexed fields**: Queries on non-indexed fields trigger full document scans. For large datasets, this causes timeouts and rate limit errors. Ensure all `where` clause fields are in the schema's `v-indexed` array.
- **Not paginating search results**: Master Data v2 has a maximum page size of 100 documents. Requesting more silently returns only up to the limit. Use proper pagination or `scrollDocuments` for large result sets.
- **Ignoring the 60-schema limit**: Each app version linked/installed creates a new schema. After 60 link cycles, the builder fails. Periodically clean up unused schemas via the Delete Schema API.
- **Using MD for logs or caches**: Entities that grow with traffic volume instead of business events. Millions of log or cache documents degrade the account's MD performance.
- **Bulk import without rate limiting**: Flooding MD with parallel writes triggers 429 errors and account-wide throttling. Always use bounded concurrency with backoff.
- **Import without validation**: Importing data without cross-referencing the catalog or user store leads to orphaned documents, broken references, and data that fails schema validation silently.
- **No checkpoint in bulk operations**: A 50k-document import that fails at document 30k must restart from zero without a checkpoint file.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is the `masterdata` builder declared in `manifest.json`?
- [ ] Do all data entities have JSON Schemas with proper field definitions?
- [ ] Are all `where` clause fields declared in `v-indexed`?
- [ ] Are CRUD operations using `ctx.clients.masterdata` or `masterDataFor` (no direct REST calls)?
- [ ] Is pagination properly handled (max 100 per page, scroll for large sets)?
- [ ] Is there a plan for schema cleanup to avoid the 60-schema limit?
- [ ] Are required policies (`outbound-access`, `ADMIN_DS`) declared in the manifest?
- [ ] Was **Catalog** or native stores ruled in/out before MD for **product** or **order** data?
- [ ] Is MD **off** the **purchase critical path** unless explicitly justified?
- [ ] If exposing MD externally, is access through a **controlled** IO/BFF layer with **auth**?
- [ ] Is the entity **not** being used for **logging**, **caching**, or **temporary** data?
- [ ] For bulk operations, are **rate limiting**, **backoff**, and **checkpoints** implemented?
- [ ] Is import data **validated** against the authoritative source before writing to MD?
- [ ] Are **native entities** (CL, AD, OD, etc.) identified and not duplicated by custom entities?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when deciding whether and how vtex io apps should use master data v2 for custom data. covers entity boundaries, schema lifecycle, indexing strategy, and when master data is the right storage mechanism versus another data approach. use for reviews, wishlists, forms, or other custom data modeling decisions in vtex io apps.

# Master Data Strategy

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when deciding whether Master Data v2 is the right mechanism for custom data in a VTEX IO app.

- Modeling reviews, wishlists, forms, or custom app records
- Choosing entity boundaries
- Planning schema indexing and lifecycle
- Reviewing long-term Master Data design

Do not use this skill for:
- low-level client usage details
- runtime or route structure
- app settings schemas
- frontend UI behavior

## Decision rules

- Use this skill once Master Data is a serious candidate storage mechanism. For the broader choice between Master Data, VBase, VTEX core APIs, and external stores, use `vtex-io-data-access-patterns`.
- Use Master Data for structured custom data that needs validation, indexing, and query support.
- Use the `masterdata` builder when this app introduces a new business entity, owns the data model, and wants the schema to be created and versioned as part of the app contract.
- Prefer using only the Master Data client when the entity and schema already exist and are shared or centrally managed, and this app only needs to read or write records without redefining the schema itself.
- For stable schemas that the app owns but should not be recreated or updated on every app version, keep the schema definition in code and use the Master Data client in a controlled setup path to create or update the schema only when needed.
- Remember that Master Data entities are account-scoped. Changing a shared entity or schema affects every app in that account that depends on it, so prefer client-only consumption when the schema is centrally managed.
- Keep entity boundaries intentional and aligned with the business concept being stored.
- Index fields that are actually used for filtering and search.
- Plan schema lifecycle explicitly to avoid schema sprawl.
- Consider data volume and retention from the start. If the dataset will grow unbounded and there is no retention or archival strategy, Master Data is likely not the right storage mechanism.
- Do not treat Master Data as an unbounded dumping ground for arbitrary payloads.
- Do not use Master Data as an unbounded log or event store for high-volume append-only data. Prefer dedicated logging or storage mechanisms when the main need is raw history rather than structured queries.
- Do not store secrets, credentials, or global app configuration in Master Data. Use app settings or configuration apps instead.
- Do not generate one entity or schema per account, workspace, or feature flag. Keep a stable entity name and distinguish tenants or environments through record fields when necessary.
- Be careful when tying schema evolution directly to app versioning through the `masterdata` builder. Frequent schema changes coupled to app releases can generate excessive schema updates, indexing changes, and long-term schema sprawl.

### Choosing between the `masterdata` builder and the Master Data client

There are three main ways for a VTEX IO app to work with Master Data:

- Owning the schema via the `masterdata` builder:
  - The app declares entities and schemas under `masterdata/` in the repository.
  - Schema fields, validation, and indexing evolve together with the app code.
  - Use this when the app is the primary owner of the data model, schema changes are relatively infrequent, and the schema should be rolled out as part of the app contract.

- Consuming an existing schema via the Master Data client only:
  - The app uses a Master Data client, but does not declare entities or schemas through the `masterdata` builder.
  - The app assumes a stable schema managed elsewhere and only reads or writes records that follow that contract.
  - Use this when the entity is shared across multiple apps or managed centrally, and this app should not redefine or fragment the schema across environments.

- Owning a stable schema definition in code and applying it through the client:
  - The app keeps a stable schema definition in code instead of `masterdata/` builder files.
  - A controlled setup path checks whether the schema exists and creates or updates it only when needed.
  - Use this when the app truly owns the schema, but should not couple schema rollout to every app version or every release pipeline step.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Master Data entities must have explicit schema boundaries

Each entity MUST represent a clear business concept and have a schema that matches its intended usage.

**Why this matters**

Weak entity boundaries create confusing queries, poor indexing choices, and schema drift.

**Detection**

If one entity mixes unrelated concepts or stores many unrelated record shapes, STOP and split the design.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "title": "review-schema-v1",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "productId": { "type": "string" },
    "userId": { "type": "string" },
    "rating": { "type": "number" },
    "approved": { "type": "boolean" }
  },
  "required": ["productId", "userId", "rating"],
  "v-indexed": ["productId", "userId", "approved"]
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "title": "everything-schema",
  "type": "object"
}
```

### Constraint: Indexed fields must match real query behavior

Fields used in filters or lookups MUST be indexed intentionally.

**Why this matters**

Missing indexes lead to poor query behavior and unnecessary operational risk.

**Detection**

If queries depend on fields that are not represented in indexing strategy, STOP and align schema and access patterns.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "v-indexed": ["productId", "approved"]
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "v-indexed": []
}
```

### Constraint: Schema lifecycle must be managed explicitly

Master Data schema evolution MUST be planned with cleanup and versioning in mind.

**Why this matters**

Unmanaged schema growth creates long-term operational pain and can run into platform limits.

**Detection**

If schema versions are added with no lifecycle or cleanup plan, STOP and define that plan.

**Correct**

```text
review-schema-v1 -> review-schema-v2 with cleanup plan
```

**Wrong**

```text
review-schema-v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 with no cleanup strategy
```

Remember that changing indexed fields or field types can affect how existing documents are indexed and queried. When schema evolution is coupled to frequent app version changes, this risk increases.

### Constraint: Entity and schema names must remain stable across environments

Entity names and schema identifiers MUST remain stable across accounts, workspaces, and environments. Do not encode account names, workspaces, or rollout flags into the entity or schema name itself.

**Why this matters**

Per-account or per-workspace schema naming leads to schema sprawl, harder lifecycle management, and operational limits that are difficult to clean up later.

**Detection**

If the design proposes one entity or schema per workspace, per account, or per environment, STOP and redesign around stable names with scoped fields or records instead.

**Correct**

```text
review-schema-v1
RV
```

**Wrong**

```text
review-schema-brazil-master
RV_US_MASTER
```

Using one clearly managed schema for development and one for production can be acceptable when there is a deliberate plan to keep them synchronized. Avoid generating schema names per workspace, per account, or per feature flag.

## Preferred pattern

Use Master Data for structured custom records, index only what you query, and plan schema evolution deliberately.

Example: app owning a schema through the `masterdata` builder

- `masterdata/review-schema-v1.json` declares the schema and indexes for the `RV` entity.
- The app then uses a dedicated Master Data client to create and query `RV` documents.

```json
{
  "title": "review-schema-v1",
  "v-entity": "RV",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "productId": { "type": "string" },
    "userId": { "type": "string" },
    "rating": { "type": "number" },
    "approved": { "type": "boolean" }
  },
  "required": ["productId", "userId", "rating"],
  "v-indexed": ["productId", "userId", "approved"]
}
```

Example: app consuming an existing schema through the client only

- This app declares no `masterdata` builder files.
- It uses the Master Data client against an existing, stable `RV` entity managed elsewhere.

```typescript
await ctx.clients.masterdata.createDocument({
  dataEntity: 'RV',
  fields: {
    productId,
    userId,
    rating,
    approved: false,
  },
})
```

Example: app owning a stable schema in code and ensuring it exists through the client

- The app keeps a stable schema definition in code.
- A controlled setup path ensures the schema exists instead of relying on the `masterdata` builder for every rollout.

```typescript
const schema = {
  title: 'review-schema-v1',
  'v-entity': 'RV',
}

const existing = await ctx.clients.masterdata.getSchema('review-schema-v1')

if (!existing) {
  await ctx.clients.masterdata.createOrUpdateSchema('review-schema-v1', schema)
}
```

## Common failure modes

- Creating entities that are too broad.
- Querying on fields that are not indexed.
- Accumulating schema versions with no lifecycle plan.
- Using Master Data as a high-volume log or event sink without retention or archival strategy.
- Storing configuration, secrets, or cross-app shared settings in Master Data instead of using configuration-specific mechanisms.
- Generating per-account or per-workspace entities such as `RV_storeA_master` instead of using a stable entity like `RV` with scoped record fields.
- Relying on the `masterdata` builder for frequent schema changes tied to every app version, causing excessive schema updates and indexing side effects over time.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is Master Data the right storage mechanism for this use case?
- [ ] Should this app own the schema through the `masterdata` builder, or just consume an existing stable schema through the client?
- [ ] Would a stable schema in code plus a controlled setup path be safer than coupling schema rollout to every app version?
- [ ] Does each entity represent a clear business concept?
- [ ] Are entity and schema names stable across workspaces and accounts?
- [ ] Are filtered fields indexed intentionally?
- [ ] Is there a schema lifecycle plan?
- [ ] If different schemas are used for development and production, is there a clear plan to keep them synchronized without creating schema sprawl?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when implementing localization and translated copy in vtex io apps. covers the `messages` builder, `/messages/*.json`, `context.json`, frontend message usage, and how vtex apps integrate with `vtex.messages` for runtime translation. use for storefront, admin, or backend flows that should use vtex io message infrastructure instead of hardcoded strings.

# Messages & Internationalization

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when a VTEX IO app needs translated copy instead of hardcoded strings.

- Adding localized UI text to storefront or Admin apps
- Creating or updating `/messages/*.json` translation files
- Defining message keys in `context.json`
- Reviewing React, Admin, or backend code that currently hardcodes user-facing copy
- Integrating app-specific translations with `vtex.messages`

Do not use this skill for:
- general UI layout or component composition
- authorization, policies, or auth tokens
- service runtime sizing
- choosing between HTTP, GraphQL, and event-driven APIs

## Decision rules

- Use the `messages` builder and translation files for user-facing copy instead of hardcoding labels, button text, or UI messages in source code.
- Keep translation keys stable, explicit, and scoped to the app domain instead of generic keys such as `title` or `button`. The exact format may vary, but keys should remain specific, descriptive, and clearly owned by the app.
- Prefix message IDs according to their UI surface or domain, for example `store/...` for storefront messages and `admin/...` for Admin or Site Editor messages, so keys stay organized and do not collide across contexts.
- Define message keys in `/messages/context.json` so VTEX IO can discover and manage the app’s translation surface. Keep it as a flat map of `messageId -> description` and include the keys the app actually uses.
- Keep translated message payloads small and app-focused. Do not turn the messages system into a general content store.
- In React or Admin UIs, prefer message IDs and localization helpers over literal copy in JSX.
- In backend or GraphQL flows, translate only when the app boundary truly needs localized text; otherwise return stable machine-oriented data and let the caller localize the presentation.
- Use app-level overrides of `vtex.messages` only when the app truly needs to customize translation behavior or message resolution beyond normal app-local message files.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: User-facing strings must come from the messages infrastructure

User-facing strings MUST come from the messages infrastructure instead of being hardcoded in components, handlers, or resolvers.

**Why this matters**

Hardcoded copy breaks localization, makes message review harder, and creates inconsistent behavior across storefront, Admin, and backend flows.

**Detection**

If you see labels, buttons, headings, alerts, or other user-facing text embedded directly in JSX or backend response formatting for a localized app, STOP and move that copy to message files.

**Correct**

```tsx
<FormattedMessage id="admin/my-app.save" />
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
<button>Save</button>
```

### Constraint: Message keys must be declared and organized explicitly

Message keys MUST be app-scoped and represented in the app’s message configuration instead of being invented ad hoc in code.

**Why this matters**

Unstructured keys become hard to maintain, collide across app areas, and make message ownership unclear.

**Detection**

If code introduces new message IDs with no corresponding translation files or `context.json` entry, STOP and add the message contract explicitly.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "admin/my-app.save": "Save"
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "save": "Save"
}
```

### Constraint: The messages system must not be used as a general content or configuration store

Translation files MUST contain localized copy, not operational configuration, secrets, or large content payloads.

**Why this matters**

The messages infrastructure is designed for translated strings. Using it for other data creates maintenance confusion and mixes localization concerns with configuration or content storage.

**Detection**

If message files contain API URLs, credentials, business rules, or long structured content blobs, STOP and move that data to app settings, configuration apps, or a content-specific mechanism.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "store/my-app.emptyState.title": "No records found"
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "apiBaseUrl": "https://partner.example.com",
  "featureFlags": {
    "betaMode": true
  }
}
```

## Preferred pattern

Recommended file layout:

```text
.
├── messages/
│   ├── context.json
│   ├── en.json
│   └── pt.json
└── react/
    └── components/
        └── SaveButton.tsx
```

Minimal messages setup:

```json
// messages/context.json
{
  "admin/my-app.save": "Label for the save action in the admin settings page"
}
```

```json
// messages/en.json
{
  "admin/my-app.save": "Save",
  "store/my-app.emptyState.title": "No records found"
}
```

```json
// messages/pt.json
{
  "admin/my-app.save": "Salvar"
}
```

```tsx
import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl'

export function SaveButton() {
  return <FormattedMessage id="admin/my-app.save" />
}
```

Backend or GraphQL translation pattern:

```graphql
scalar IOMessage

type ProductLabel {
  id: ID
  label: IOMessage
}

type Query {
  productLabel(id: ID!): ProductLabel
}
```

```typescript
export const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    productLabel: async (_: unknown, { id }: { id: string }) => {
      return {
        id,
        label: {
          content: 'store/my-app.product-label',
          description: 'Label for product badge',
          from: 'en-US',
        },
      }
    },
  },
}
```

Keep a complete `en.json` as the default fallback, even when the app’s main audience uses another locale, so the messages system has a stable base for resolution and auto-translation behavior.

Use translated IDs in code, keep translation files explicit, and centralize user-facing copy in the messages system instead of scattering literals through the app.

## Common failure modes

- Hardcoding user-facing strings in JSX, resolvers, or handler responses.
- Adding new message IDs in code without updating `context.json` or the message files.
- Using generic or collision-prone keys such as `title`, `save`, or `button`.
- Storing configuration values or non-localized business payloads in message files.
- Treating `vtex.messages` overrides as the default path instead of app-local message management.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Are user-facing strings sourced from the messages infrastructure instead of hardcoded in code?
- [ ] Are message keys explicit, app-scoped, and declared consistently?
- [ ] Does `context.json` reflect the translation surface used by the app?
- [ ] Are message files limited to localized copy rather than configuration or operational data?
- [ ] Is any customization of `vtex.messages` truly necessary for this app?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when making vtex io services easier to observe, troubleshoot, and operate in production. covers metrics, structured logging, failure visibility, rate-limit awareness, and production readiness checks for backend apps. use for integration monitoring, error diagnosis, or improving the operational quality of vtex io services before or after release.

# Observability & Operational Readiness

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when a VTEX IO service needs better production visibility, troubleshooting behavior, or operational safety.

- Adding metrics to important client calls or flows
- Improving logs for routes, workers, or integrations
- Surfacing failures clearly for operations and support
- Reviewing whether a service is ready for production
- Monitoring rate-limit-sensitive integrations

Do not use this skill for:
- app policy declaration
- trust-boundary modeling
- frontend analytics or browser monitoring
- route contract design by itself

## Decision rules

- Log enough structured context to debug failures, but do not log secrets or sensitive payloads.
- Use `ctx.vtex.logger` with appropriate log levels such as `info`, `warn`, and `error` instead of `console.log`, so logs are properly collected and searchable in the VTEX logging stack.
- Treat `ctx.vtex.logger` as the native platform logging mechanism. If a partner needs to forward logs to its own logging system, prefer doing that through a dedicated integration app or client instead of replacing the VTEX logger pattern inside every service.
- Use client-level metrics on important downstream calls so integration behavior is visible below the handler layer.
- Choose metric names that reflect the integration and operation, such as `partner-get-order` or `partner-sync-catalog`, so counts, latency, and error rates can be tracked over time.
- Make failures observable at the point where they happen. Do not swallow errors silently in routes, events, or workers.
- For rate-limit-sensitive APIs, combine short timeouts, backoff-aware retries, and caching of frequent reads to reduce burst pressure and avoid hitting hard limits.
- Review whether expensive or fragile flows expose enough operational signals before releasing them.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Important failures must be visible in logs, metrics, or durable state

Routes, event handlers, and workers MUST not hide important failures from operators.

**Why this matters**

If failures disappear silently, the service becomes impossible to diagnose under real traffic and retries.

**Detection**

If an error is caught and ignored without logging, metric emission, or explicit failure state, STOP and surface the failure.

**Correct**

```typescript
try {
  await ctx.clients.partnerApi.sendOrder(orderId)
} catch (error) {
  ctx.vtex.logger.error({
    message: 'Failed to send order to partner',
    orderId,
    account: ctx.vtex.account,
    routeId: ctx.vtex.route?.id,
  })
  throw error
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
try {
  await ctx.clients.partnerApi.sendOrder(orderId)
} catch (_) {
  return
}
```

### Constraint: Metrics should be attached to important integration calls

Client calls that are operationally important SHOULD include `metric` so request behavior can be tracked consistently.

**Why this matters**

Without metrics, integration failures and latency patterns are much harder to isolate from generic route behavior.

**Detection**

If a key downstream integration call has no `metric` and operations depend on it, STOP and add a meaningful metric name.

**Correct**

```typescript
return this.http.get(`/orders/${id}`, {
  metric: 'partner-get-order',
})
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
return this.http.get(`/orders/${id}`)
```

### Constraint: Logs must stay useful without leaking sensitive data

Logs MUST contain enough context to debug production behavior, but MUST NOT include secrets, tokens, or unnecessarily sensitive payloads.

**Why this matters**

Operational logs are only valuable if they are safe to retain and inspect. Sensitive logging creates security risk while still failing to guarantee useful diagnosis.

**Detection**

If a log line includes tokens, auth headers, raw personal payloads, or entire downstream responses, STOP and sanitize the log.

**Correct**

```typescript
ctx.vtex.logger.info({
  message: 'Partner sync started',
  orderId,
  account: ctx.vtex.account,
})
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
ctx.vtex.logger.info({
  message: 'Partner sync started',
  body: ctx.request.body,
  auth: ctx.request.header.authorization,
})
```

## Preferred pattern

Operationally healthy VTEX IO services should:

- emit metrics for important client calls so counts, latency, and error rates are visible
- log failures with enough structured context such as domain IDs, account, and `routeId`
- avoid silent error swallowing
- sanitize sensitive data before logging
- review retries, caching, and throughput with rate-limit behavior in mind

Use observability to shorten diagnosis time, not just to create more logs.

## Common failure modes

- Catching and ignoring errors in async flows.
- Logging too little context to diagnose production incidents.
- Logging too much sensitive data.
- Omitting metrics from important integration calls.
- Treating rate-limit failures as isolated bugs instead of operational signals.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Are important failures visible to operators?
- [ ] Do key integrations emit useful metrics?
- [ ] Are logs structured and safe?
- [ ] Are retries, caching, and rate-limit behavior considered together?
- [ ] Would someone on call be able to diagnose this flow from the available signals?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when building react components under react/ or configuring store blocks in store/ for vtex io apps. covers interfaces.json, contentschemas.json for site editor, vtex styleguide for admin apps, and css-handles for storefront styling. use for creating custom storefront components, admin panels, pixel apps, or any frontend development within the vtex io react builder ecosystem.

# Frontend React Components & Hooks

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when building VTEX IO frontend apps using the `react` builder — creating React components that integrate with Store Framework as theme blocks, configuring `interfaces.json`, setting up `contentSchemas.json` for Site Editor, and applying styling patterns.

- Creating custom storefront components (product displays, forms, banners)
- Building admin panel interfaces with VTEX Styleguide
- Registering components as Store Framework blocks
- Exposing component props in Site Editor via `contentSchemas.json`
- Applying `css-handles` for safe storefront styling

Do not use this skill for:
- Backend service implementation (use `vtex-io-service-apps` instead)
- GraphQL schema and resolver development (use `vtex-io-graphql-api` instead)
- Manifest and builder configuration (use `vtex-io-app-structure` instead)

## Decision rules

- Every visible storefront element is a **block**. Blocks are declared in theme JSON and map to React components via **interfaces**.
- `interfaces.json` (in `/store`) maps block names to React component files: `"component"` is the file name in `/react` (without extension), `"allowed"` lists child blocks, `"composition"` controls how children work (`"children"` or `"blocks"`).
- Each exported component MUST have a root-level file in `/react` that re-exports it. The builder resolves `"component": "ProductReviews"` to `react/ProductReviews.tsx`.
- For **storefront** components, use `vtex.css-handles` for styling (not inline styles, not global CSS).
- For **admin** components, use `vtex.styleguide` — the official VTEX Admin component library. No third-party UI libraries.
- Use `contentSchemas.json` in `/store` to make component props editable in Site Editor (JSON Schema format).
- Use `react-intl` and the `messages` builder for i18n — never hardcode user-facing strings.
- Fetch data via GraphQL queries (`useQuery` from `react-apollo`), never via direct API calls from the browser.

Architecture:

```text
Store Theme (JSON blocks)
  └── declares "product-reviews" block with props
        │
        ▼
interfaces.json → maps "product-reviews" to "ProductReviews" component
        │
        ▼
react/ProductReviews.tsx → React component renders
        │
        ├── useCssHandles() → CSS classes for styling
        ├── useQuery() → GraphQL data fetching
        └── useProduct() / useOrderForm() → Store Framework context hooks
```

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Declare Interfaces for All Storefront Blocks

Every React component that should be usable as a Store Framework block MUST have a corresponding entry in `store/interfaces.json`. Without the interface declaration, the block cannot be referenced in theme JSON files.

**Why this matters**

The store builder resolves block names to React components through `interfaces.json`. If a component has no interface, it is invisible to Store Framework and will not render on the storefront.

**Detection**

If a React component in `/react` is intended for storefront use but has no matching entry in `store/interfaces.json`, warn the developer. The component will compile but never render.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "product-reviews": {
    "component": "ProductReviews",
    "composition": "children",
    "allowed": ["product-review-item"]
  },
  "product-review-item": {
    "component": "ReviewItem"
  }
}
```

```tsx
// react/ProductReviews.tsx
import ProductReviews from './components/ProductReviews'

export default ProductReviews
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
// react/ProductReviews.tsx exists but NO store/interfaces.json entry
// The component compiles fine but cannot be used in any theme.
// Adding <product-reviews /> in a theme JSON will produce:
// "Block 'product-reviews' not found"
import ProductReviews from './components/ProductReviews'

export default ProductReviews
```

---

### Constraint: Use VTEX Styleguide for Admin UIs

Admin panel components (apps using the `admin` builder) MUST use VTEX Styleguide (`vtex.styleguide`) for UI elements. You MUST NOT use third-party UI libraries like Material UI, Chakra UI, or Ant Design in admin apps.

**Why this matters**

VTEX Admin has a consistent design language enforced by Styleguide. Third-party UI libraries produce inconsistent visuals, may conflict with the Admin's global CSS, and add unnecessary bundle size. Apps submitted to the VTEX App Store with non-Styleguide admin UIs will fail review.

**Detection**

If you see imports from `@material-ui`, `@chakra-ui/react`, `@chakra-ui`, `antd`, or `@ant-design` in an admin app, warn the developer to use `vtex.styleguide` instead.

**Correct**

```tsx
// react/admin/ReviewModeration.tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import {
  Layout,
  PageHeader,
  Table,
  Button,
  Tag,
  Modal,
  Input,
} from 'vtex.styleguide'

interface Review {
  id: string
  author: string
  rating: number
  text: string
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected'
}

function ReviewModeration() {
  const [reviews, setReviews] = useState<Review[]>([])
  const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false)

  const tableSchema = {
    properties: {
      author: { title: 'Author', width: 200 },
      rating: { title: 'Rating', width: 100 },
      text: { title: 'Review Text' },
      status: {
        title: 'Status',
        width: 150,
        cellRenderer: ({ cellData }: { cellData: string }) => (
          <Tag type={cellData === 'approved' ? 'success' : 'error'}>
            {cellData}
          </Tag>
        ),
      },
    },
  }

  return (
    <Layout fullWidth pageHeader={<PageHeader title="Review Moderation" />}>
      <Table
        items={reviews}
        schema={tableSchema}
        density="medium"
      />
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default ReviewModeration
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
// react/admin/ReviewModeration.tsx
import React from 'react'
import { DataGrid } from '@material-ui/data-grid'
import { Button } from '@material-ui/core'

// Material UI components will look inconsistent in the VTEX Admin,
// conflict with global styles, and inflate bundle size.
// This app will fail VTEX App Store review.
function ReviewModeration() {
  return (
    <div>
      <DataGrid rows={[]} columns={[]} />
      <Button variant="contained" color="primary">Approve</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

### Constraint: Export Components from react/ Root Level

Every Store Framework block component MUST have a root-level export file in the `/react` directory that matches the `component` value in `interfaces.json`. The actual implementation can live in subdirectories, but the root file must exist.

**Why this matters**

The react builder resolves components by looking for files at the root of `/react`. If `interfaces.json` declares `"component": "ProductReviews"`, the builder looks for `react/ProductReviews.tsx`. Without this root export file, the component will not be found and the block will fail to render.

**Detection**

If `interfaces.json` references a component name that does not have a matching file at the root of `/react`, STOP and create the export file.

**Correct**

```tsx
// react/ProductReviews.tsx — root-level export file
import ProductReviews from './components/ProductReviews/index'

export default ProductReviews
```

```tsx
// react/components/ProductReviews/index.tsx — actual implementation
import React from 'react'
import { useCssHandles } from 'vtex.css-handles'

const CSS_HANDLES = ['container', 'title', 'list'] as const

interface Props {
  title: string
  maxReviews: number
}

function ProductReviews({ title, maxReviews }: Props) {
  const handles = useCssHandles(CSS_HANDLES)
  return (
    <div className={handles.container}>
      <h2 className={handles.title}>{title}</h2>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  )
}

export default ProductReviews
```

**Wrong**

```text
react/components/ProductReviews/index.tsx exists but
react/ProductReviews.tsx does NOT exist.
The builder cannot find the component.
Error: "Could not find component ProductReviews"
```

## Preferred pattern

Create the React component inside a subdirectory:

```tsx
// react/components/ProductReviews/index.tsx
import React, { useMemo } from 'react'
import { useQuery } from 'react-apollo'
import { useProduct } from 'vtex.product-context'
import { useCssHandles } from 'vtex.css-handles'

import GET_REVIEWS from '../../graphql/getReviews.graphql'
import ReviewItem from './ReviewItem'

const CSS_HANDLES = [
  'reviewsContainer',
  'reviewsTitle',
  'reviewsList',
  'averageRating',
  'emptyState',
] as const

interface Props {
  title?: string
  showAverage?: boolean
  maxReviews?: number
}

function ProductReviews({
  title = 'Customer Reviews',
  showAverage = true,
  maxReviews = 10,
}: Props) {
  const handles = useCssHandles(CSS_HANDLES)
  const productContext = useProduct()
  const productId = productContext?.product?.productId

  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_REVIEWS, {
    variables: { productId, limit: maxReviews },
    skip: !productId,
  })

  const averageRating = useMemo(() => {
    if (!data?.reviews?.length) return 0

    const sum = data.reviews.reduce(
      (acc: number, review: { rating: number }) => acc + review.rating,
      0
    )

    return (sum / data.reviews.length).toFixed(1)
  }, [data])

  if (loading) return <div className={handles.reviewsContainer}>Loading...</div>
  if (error) return null

  return (
    <div className={handles.reviewsContainer}>
      <h2 className={handles.reviewsTitle}>{title}</h2>

      {showAverage && data?.reviews?.length > 0 && (
        <div className={handles.averageRating}>
          Average: {averageRating} / 5
        </div>
      )}

      {data?.reviews?.length === 0 ? (
        <p className={handles.emptyState}>No reviews yet.</p>
      ) : (
        <ul className={handles.reviewsList}>
          {data.reviews.map((review: { id: string; author: string; rating: number; text: string }) => (
            <ReviewItem key={review.id} review={review} />
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default ProductReviews
```

Root export file:

```tsx
// react/ProductReviews.tsx
import ProductReviews from './components/ProductReviews'

export default ProductReviews
```

Block interface:

```json
{
  "product-reviews": {
    "component": "ProductReviews",
    "composition": "children",
    "allowed": ["product-review-form"],
    "render": "client"
  }
}
```

Site Editor schema:

```json
{
  "definitions": {
    "ProductReviews": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "title": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Section Title",
          "description": "Title displayed above the reviews list",
          "default": "Customer Reviews"
        },
        "showAverage": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "title": "Show average rating",
          "default": true
        },
        "maxReviews": {
          "type": "number",
          "title": "Maximum reviews",
          "default": 10,
          "enum": [5, 10, 20, 50]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Using the component in a Store Framework theme:

```json
{
  "store.product": {
    "children": [
      "product-images",
      "product-name",
      "product-price",
      "buy-button",
      "product-reviews"
    ]
  },
  "product-reviews": {
    "props": {
      "title": "What Our Customers Say",
      "showAverage": true,
      "maxReviews": 20
    }
  }
}
```

## Common failure modes

- **Importing third-party UI libraries for admin apps**: Using `@material-ui/core`, `@chakra-ui/react`, or `antd` conflicts with VTEX Admin's global CSS, produces inconsistent visuals, and will fail App Store review. Use `vtex.styleguide` instead.
- **Directly calling APIs from React components**: Using `fetch()` or `axios` exposes authentication tokens to the client and bypasses CORS restrictions. Use GraphQL queries that resolve server-side via `useQuery` from `react-apollo`.
- **Hardcoded strings without i18n**: Components with hardcoded strings only work in one language. Use the `messages` builder and `react-intl` for internationalization.
- **Missing root-level export file**: If `interfaces.json` references `"component": "ProductReviews"` but `react/ProductReviews.tsx` doesn't exist, the block silently fails to render.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Does every storefront block have a matching entry in `store/interfaces.json`?
- [ ] Does every `interfaces.json` component have a root-level export file in `/react`?
- [ ] Are admin apps using `vtex.styleguide` (no third-party UI libraries)?
- [ ] Are storefront components using `css-handles` for styling?
- [ ] Is data fetched via GraphQL (`useQuery`), not direct API calls?
- [ ] Are user-facing strings using `react-intl` and the `messages` builder?
- [ ] Is `contentSchemas.json` defined for Site Editor-editable props?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when connecting react components to store framework blocks and render-runtime behavior in vtex io. covers interfaces.json, block registration, block composition, and how storefront components become configurable theme blocks. use for block mapping, theme integration, or reviewing whether a react component is correctly exposed to store framework.

# Render Runtime & Block Registration

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when a VTEX IO storefront component needs to be exposed to Store Framework as a block.

- Registering components in `store/interfaces.json`
- Mapping block names to React components
- Defining block composition and allowed children
- Reviewing whether a component is correctly wired into theme JSON

Do not use this skill for:
- shopper-facing component internals
- admin interfaces
- backend service or route design
- policy modeling

## Decision rules

- Every block visible to Store Framework must be registered in `store/interfaces.json`.
- Keep block names, component mapping, and composition explicit.
- The block ID used as the key in `store/interfaces.json`, for example `product-reviews`, is the same ID that storefront themes reference under `blocks` in `store/*.json`.
- The `component` field should map to the React entry name under `react/`, such as `ProductReviews`, or a nested path such as `product/ProductReviews` when the app structure is hierarchical.
- Use `composition` intentionally when the block needs an explicit child model. `children` means the component renders nested blocks through `props.children`, while `blocks` means the block exposes named block slots controlled by Store Framework.
- `composition` is optional. For many simple blocks, declaring `component` and, when needed, `allowed` is enough.
- Use this skill for the render/runtime contract, and use storefront/admin skills for the component implementation itself.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Storefront blocks must be declared in interfaces.json

Every React component intended for Store Framework use MUST have a corresponding `interfaces.json` entry.

**Why this matters**

Without the interface declaration, the component cannot be referenced from theme JSON.

**Detection**

If a storefront React component is intended to be used as a block but has no matching interface entry, STOP and add it first.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "product-reviews": {
    "component": "ProductReviews"
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
// react/ProductReviews.tsx exists with no interfaces.json mapping
```

### Constraint: Component mapping must resolve to real React entry files

The `component` field in `interfaces.json` MUST map to a real exported React entry file.

**Why this matters**

Broken mapping silently disconnects block contracts from implementation.

**Detection**

If an interface points to a component name with no corresponding React entry file, STOP and fix the mapping.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "product-reviews": {
    "component": "ProductReviews"
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "product-reviews": {
    "component": "MissingComponent"
  }
}
```

### Constraint: Block composition must be intentional

Composition and allowed child blocks MUST match the component's actual layout and runtime expectations.

**Why this matters**

Incorrect composition contracts make theme usage brittle and confusing.

**Detection**

If `allowed` or `composition` do not reflect how the component is supposed to receive children, STOP and correct the block contract.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "product-reviews": {
    "component": "ProductReviews",
    "composition": "children",
    "allowed": ["product-review-item"]
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "product-reviews": {
    "component": "ProductReviews",
    "composition": "blocks",
    "allowed": []
  }
}
```

## Preferred pattern

Keep block contracts explicit in `interfaces.json` and keep block implementation concerns separate from render-runtime registration.

Minimal block lifecycle:

```json
// store/interfaces.json
{
  "product-reviews": {
    "component": "ProductReviews",
    "composition": "children",
    "allowed": ["product-review-item"]
  },
  "product-review-item": {
    "component": "ProductReviewItem"
  }
}
```

```json
// store/home.json
{
  "store.home": {
    "blocks": ["product-reviews"]
  }
}
```

```tsx
// react/ProductReviews.tsx
export default function ProductReviews() {
  return <div>...</div>
}
```

This wiring makes the block name visible in the theme, maps it to a real React entry, and keeps composition rules explicit at the render-runtime boundary.

## Common failure modes

- Forgetting to register a storefront component as a block.
- Mapping block names to missing React entry files.
- Using the wrong composition model.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is the block declared in `interfaces.json`?
- [ ] Does the component mapping resolve correctly?
- [ ] Are composition and allowed children intentional?
- [ ] Is runtime registration clearly separated from component internals?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when reviewing or designing security-sensitive boundaries in vtex io apps. covers public versus private exposure, trust assumptions at route and integration boundaries, sensitive data handling, validating what crosses the app boundary, and avoiding leakage across accounts, workspaces, users, or integrations. use for route hardening, data exposure review, or evaluating whether a service boundary is too permissive.

# Security Boundaries & Exposure Review

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when the main question is whether a VTEX IO route, integration, or service boundary is safe.

- Reviewing public versus private route exposure
- Validating external input at service boundaries
- Handling tokens, account context, or sensitive payloads
- Avoiding cross-account, cross-workspace, or cross-user leakage
- Hardening integrations that expose or consume sensitive data

Do not use this skill for:
- policy declaration syntax in `manifest.json`
- service runtime sizing
- logging and observability strategy
- frontend browser security concerns
- deciding which VTEX auth token should call an endpoint

## Decision rules

- Use this skill to decide what data and input may safely cross the app boundary, not which policies or tokens authorize the call.
- Treat every public route as an explicit trust boundary.
- In `service.json`, changing a route from `public: false` to `public: true` is a boundary change and should trigger explicit security review.
- Use `public: true` for routes that must be callable from outside VTEX IO, such as partner webhooks or externally consumed integration endpoints. Treat them as internet-exposed boundaries.
- Use `public: false` for routes that are meant only for VTEX internal flows or other IO apps, but do not treat them as implicitly safe. They still require validation and scoped assumptions.
- A route with `public: true` in `service.json` is reachable from outside the app as long as the account domain is accessible. Do not rely on obscure paths or internal-looking URLs as a security measure.
- Validate external input as early as possible, before it reaches domain logic or downstream integrations.
- For webhook-style routes, validate both structure and authenticity, for example through required fields plus a shared secret or signature header, before calling downstream clients.
- Do not assume a request is safe because it originated from another VTEX service or internal-looking route path.
- Keep account, workspace, and user context explicit when a service reads or writes scoped data.
- When data or behavior must be restricted to a specific workspace, check `ctx.vtex.workspace` explicitly and reject calls from other workspaces.
- Never expose more data than the caller needs. Shape responses intentionally instead of returning raw downstream payloads.
- Keep secrets, tokens, and security-sensitive headers out of logs and route responses.
- Do not use `console.log` or `console.error` in production routes or services. Use `ctx.vtex.logger` for application logging with structured objects, and only use a dedicated external logging client when the app intentionally forwards logs to a partner-owned system.
- Avoid exposing debug or diagnostic routes that return internal configuration, secrets, or full downstream payloads. If such routes are strictly necessary, keep them non-public and limited to minimal, non-sensitive information.
- Use this skill to decide what may cross the boundary, and use `vtex-io-auth-and-policies` to decide how that boundary is authorized and protected.

## Related skills

- [`vtex-io-auth-and-policies`](../vtex-io-auth-and-policies/skill.md) - Use when the main decision is how route or resource access will be authorized
- [`vtex-io-auth-tokens-and-context`](../vtex-io-auth-tokens-and-context/skill.md) - Use when the main decision is which runtime identity should call VTEX endpoints

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Public routes must validate untrusted input at the boundary

Any route exposed beyond a tightly controlled internal boundary MUST validate incoming data before calling domain logic or downstream clients.

**Why this matters**

Unvalidated input at public boundaries creates the fastest path to abuse, bad writes, and accidental downstream failures.

**Detection**

If a public route forwards body fields, params, or headers directly into business logic or client calls without validation, STOP and add validation first.

**Correct**

```typescript
export async function webhook(ctx: Context) {
  const body = ctx.request.body

  if (!body?.eventId || !body?.type) {
    ctx.status = 400
    ctx.body = { message: 'Invalid payload' }
    return
  }

  await ctx.clients.partnerApi.handleWebhook(body)
  ctx.status = 202
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
export async function webhook(ctx: Context) {
  await ctx.clients.partnerApi.handleWebhook(ctx.request.body)
  ctx.status = 202
}
```

### Constraint: Sensitive data must not cross route boundaries by accident

Routes and integrations MUST not leak tokens, internal headers, raw downstream payloads, or data that belongs to another account, workspace, or user context.

**Why this matters**

Boundary leaks are hard to detect once deployed and can expose information far beyond the intended caller scope.

**Detection**

If a route returns raw downstream responses, logs secrets, or mixes contexts without explicit filtering, STOP and narrow the output before proceeding.

**Correct**

```typescript
ctx.body = {
  orderId: order.id,
  status: order.status,
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
ctx.body = order
```

### Constraint: Trust boundaries must stay explicit when services call each other

When one service calls another, the receiving boundary MUST still be treated as a real security boundary with explicit validation and scoped assumptions.

**Why this matters**

Internal service-to-service traffic can still carry malformed or overbroad data. Assuming “internal means trusted” leads to fragile security posture and cross-context leakage.

**Detection**

If a service accepts data from another service without validating format, scope, or account/workspace context, STOP and make those checks explicit.

**Correct**

```typescript
if (ctx.vtex.account !== expectedAccount) {
  ctx.status = 403
  return
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
await processPartnerPayload(ctx.request.body)
```

## Preferred pattern

Security review should start at the boundary:

1. Who can call this route or trigger this integration?
2. What data enters the system?
3. What must be validated immediately?
4. What data leaves the system?
5. Could account, workspace, or user context leak across the boundary?

Use minimal request and response shapes, explicit validation, and scoped context checks to keep boundaries safe.

## Common failure modes

- Treating public routes like trusted internal handlers.
- Returning raw downstream payloads that expose more data than necessary.
- Logging secrets or security-sensitive headers.
- Using `console.log` in handlers instead of `ctx.vtex.logger`, making logs less structured and increasing the risk of leaking sensitive data.
- Mixing account or workspace context without explicit checks.
- Assuming service-to-service traffic is inherently safe.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is the trust boundary clear?
- [ ] Are external inputs validated before reaching domain or integration logic?
- [ ] Is the response shape intentionally minimal?
- [ ] Are sensitive values kept out of logs and responses?
- [ ] Could account, workspace, or user context leak across this boundary?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when building backend service apps under node/ in a vtex io project or configuring service.json routes. covers the service class, middleware functions, ctx.clients pattern, janusclient, externalclient, masterdataclient, and ioclients registration. use for implementing backend apis, event handlers, or integrations that must use @vtex/api clients instead of raw http libraries.

# Backend Service Apps & API Clients

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when developing a VTEX IO app that needs backend logic — REST API routes, GraphQL resolvers, event handlers, scheduled tasks, or integrations with VTEX Commerce APIs and external services.

- Building the Service entry point (`node/index.ts`) with typed context, clients, and state
- Creating and registering custom clients extending JanusClient or ExternalClient
- Using `ctx.clients` to access clients with built-in caching, retry, and metrics
- Configuring routes and middleware chains in service.json

Do not use this skill for:
- Manifest and builder configuration (use `vtex-io-app-structure` instead)
- GraphQL schema definitions (use `vtex-io-graphql-api` instead)
- React component development (use `vtex-io-react-apps` instead)

## Decision rules

- The Service class (`node/index.ts`) is the entry point for every VTEX IO backend app. It receives clients, routes (with middleware chains), GraphQL resolvers, and event handlers.
- Every middleware, resolver, and event handler receives `ctx` with: `ctx.clients` (registered clients), `ctx.state` (mutable per-request state), `ctx.vtex` (auth tokens, account info), `ctx.body` (request/response body).
- Use `JanusClient` for VTEX internal APIs (base URL: `https://{account}.vtexcommercestable.com.br`).
- Use `ExternalClient` for non-VTEX APIs (any URL you specify).
- Use `AppClient` for routes exposed by other VTEX IO apps.
- Use `MasterDataClient` for Master Data v2 CRUD operations.
- Register custom clients by extending `IOClients` — each client is lazily instantiated on first access via `this.getOrSet()`.
- Keep clients as thin data-access wrappers. Put business logic in middlewares or service functions.

Client hierarchy:

| Class | Use Case | Base URL |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `JanusClient` | Access VTEX internal APIs (Janus gateway) | `https://{account}.vtexcommercestable.com.br` |
| `ExternalClient` | Access external (non-VTEX) APIs | Any URL you specify |
| `AppClient` | Access routes exposed by other VTEX IO apps | `https://{workspace}--{account}.myvtex.com` |
| `InfraClient` | Access VTEX IO infrastructure services | Internal |
| `MasterDataClient` | Access Master Data v2 CRUD operations | VTEX API |

Architecture:

```text
Request → VTEX IO Runtime → Service
  ├── routes → middleware chain → ctx.clients.{name}.method()
  ├── graphql → resolvers → ctx.clients.{name}.method()
  └── events → handlers → ctx.clients.{name}.method()
                               │
                               ▼
                         Client (JanusClient / ExternalClient)
                               │
                               ▼
                    External Service / VTEX API
```

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Use @vtex/api Clients — Never Raw HTTP Libraries

All HTTP communication from a VTEX IO service app MUST go through `@vtex/api` clients (JanusClient, ExternalClient, AppClient, or native clients from `@vtex/clients`). You MUST NOT use `axios`, `fetch`, `got`, `node-fetch`, or any other raw HTTP library.

**Why this matters**

VTEX IO clients provide automatic authentication header injection, built-in caching (disk and memory), retry with exponential backoff, timeout management, native metrics and billing tracking, and proper error handling. Raw HTTP libraries bypass all of these. Additionally, outbound traffic from VTEX IO is firewalled — only `@vtex/api` clients properly route through the infrastructure.

**Detection**

If you see `import axios from 'axios'`, `import fetch from 'node-fetch'`, `import got from 'got'`, `require('node-fetch')`, or any direct `fetch()` call in a VTEX IO service app, STOP. Replace with a proper client extending JanusClient or ExternalClient.

**Correct**

```typescript
import type { InstanceOptions, IOContext } from '@vtex/api'
import { ExternalClient } from '@vtex/api'

export class WeatherClient extends ExternalClient {
  constructor(context: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super('https://api.weather.com', context, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        'X-Api-Key': 'my-key',
        ...options?.headers,
      },
    })
  }

  public async getForecast(city: string): Promise<Forecast> {
    return this.http.get(`/v1/forecast/${city}`, {
      metric: 'weather-forecast',
    })
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
import axios from 'axios'

// This bypasses VTEX IO infrastructure entirely.
// No caching, no retries, no metrics, no auth token injection.
// Outbound requests may be blocked by the firewall.
export async function getForecast(city: string): Promise<Forecast> {
  const response = await axios.get(`https://api.weather.com/v1/forecast/${city}`, {
    headers: { 'X-Api-Key': 'my-key' },
  })
  return response.data
}
```

---

### Constraint: Access Clients via ctx.clients — Never Instantiate Directly

Clients MUST always be accessed through `ctx.clients.{clientName}` in middlewares, resolvers, and event handlers. You MUST NOT instantiate client classes directly with `new`.

**Why this matters**

The IOClients registry manages client lifecycle, ensuring proper initialization with the current request's IOContext (account, workspace, auth tokens). Direct instantiation creates clients without authentication context, without caching configuration, and without connection to the metrics pipeline.

**Detection**

If you see `new MyClient(...)` or `new ExternalClient(...)` inside a middleware or resolver, STOP. The client should be registered in the Clients class and accessed via `ctx.clients`.

**Correct**

```typescript
// node/clients/index.ts
import { IOClients } from '@vtex/api'
import { CatalogClient } from './catalogClient'

export class Clients extends IOClients {
  public get catalog() {
    return this.getOrSet('catalog', CatalogClient)
  }
}

// node/middlewares/getProduct.ts
export async function getProduct(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const { clients: { catalog } } = ctx
  const product = await catalog.getProductById(ctx.query.id)
  ctx.body = product
  ctx.status = 200
  await next()
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
// node/middlewares/getProduct.ts
import { CatalogClient } from '../clients/catalogClient'

export async function getProduct(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  // Direct instantiation — no auth context, no caching, no metrics
  const catalog = new CatalogClient(ctx.vtex, {})
  const product = await catalog.getProductById(ctx.query.id)
  ctx.body = product
  ctx.status = 200
  await next()
}
```

---

### Constraint: Avoid Monolithic Service Apps

A single service app SHOULD NOT define more than 10 HTTP routes. If you need more, consider splitting into focused microservice apps.

**Why this matters**

VTEX IO apps run in containers with limited memory (max 512MB). A monolithic app with many routes increases memory usage, cold start time, and blast radius of failures. The VTEX IO platform is designed for small, focused apps that compose together.

**Detection**

If `service.json` defines more than 10 routes, warn the developer to consider splitting the app into smaller services. This is a soft limit — there may be valid exceptions.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "memory": 256,
  "timeout": 30,
  "routes": {
    "get-reviews": { "path": "/_v/api/reviews", "public": false },
    "get-review": { "path": "/_v/api/reviews/:id", "public": false },
    "create-review": { "path": "/_v/api/reviews", "public": false },
    "moderate-review": { "path": "/_v/api/reviews/:id/moderate", "public": false }
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "memory": 512,
  "timeout": 60,
  "routes": {
    "route1": { "path": "/_v/api/reviews" },
    "route2": { "path": "/_v/api/reviews/:id" },
    "route3": { "path": "/_v/api/products" },
    "route4": { "path": "/_v/api/products/:id" },
    "route5": { "path": "/_v/api/orders" },
    "route6": { "path": "/_v/api/orders/:id" },
    "route7": { "path": "/_v/api/users" },
    "route8": { "path": "/_v/api/users/:id" },
    "route9": { "path": "/_v/api/categories" },
    "route10": { "path": "/_v/api/categories/:id" },
    "route11": { "path": "/_v/api/brands" },
    "route12": { "path": "/_v/api/inventory" }
  }
}
```

12 routes covering reviews, products, orders, users, categories, brands, and inventory — this should be 3-4 separate apps.

## Preferred pattern

Define custom clients:

```typescript
// node/clients/catalogClient.ts
import type { InstanceOptions, IOContext } from '@vtex/api'
import { JanusClient } from '@vtex/api'

export class CatalogClient extends JanusClient {
  constructor(context: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        VtexIdclientAutCookie: context.authToken,
        ...options?.headers,
      },
    })
  }

  public async getProduct(productId: string): Promise<Product> {
    return this.http.get(`/api/catalog/pvt/product/${productId}`, {
      metric: 'catalog-get-product',
    })
  }

  public async listSkusByProduct(productId: string): Promise<Sku[]> {
    return this.http.get(`/api/catalog_system/pvt/sku/stockkeepingunitByProductId/${productId}`, {
      metric: 'catalog-list-skus',
    })
  }
}
```

Register clients in IOClients:

```typescript
// node/clients/index.ts
import { IOClients } from '@vtex/api'
import { CatalogClient } from './catalogClient'
import { ReviewStorageClient } from './reviewStorageClient'

export class Clients extends IOClients {
  public get catalog() {
    return this.getOrSet('catalog', CatalogClient)
  }

  public get reviewStorage() {
    return this.getOrSet('reviewStorage', ReviewStorageClient)
  }
}
```

Create middlewares using `ctx.clients` and `ctx.state`:

```typescript
// node/middlewares/getReviews.ts
import type { ServiceContext } from '@vtex/api'
import type { Clients } from '../clients'

type Context = ServiceContext<Clients>

export async function validateParams(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const { productId } = ctx.query

  if (!productId || typeof productId !== 'string') {
    ctx.status = 400
    ctx.body = { error: 'productId query parameter is required' }
    return
  }

  ctx.state.productId = productId
  await next()
}

export async function getReviews(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const { productId } = ctx.state
  const reviews = await ctx.clients.reviewStorage.getByProduct(productId)

  ctx.status = 200
  ctx.body = reviews
  await next()
}
```

Wire everything in the Service entry point:

```typescript
// node/index.ts
import type { ParamsContext, RecorderState } from '@vtex/api'
import { Service, method } from '@vtex/api'

import { Clients } from './clients'
import { validateParams, getReviews } from './middlewares/getReviews'
import { createReview } from './middlewares/createReview'
import { resolvers } from './resolvers'

export default new Service<Clients, RecorderState, ParamsContext>({
  clients: {
    implementation: Clients,
    options: {
      default: {
        retries: 2,
        timeout: 5000,
      },
      catalog: {
        retries: 3,
        timeout: 10000,
      },
    },
  },
  routes: {
    reviews: method({
      GET: [validateParams, getReviews],
      POST: [createReview],
    }),
  },
  graphql: {
    resolvers: {
      Query: resolvers.queries,
      Mutation: resolvers.mutations,
    },
  },
})
```

## Common failure modes

- **Using axios/fetch/got/node-fetch for HTTP calls**: These libraries bypass the entire VTEX IO infrastructure — no automatic auth token injection, no caching, no retry logic, no metrics. Outbound requests may also be blocked by the firewall. Create a proper client extending `ExternalClient` or `JanusClient` instead.
- **Putting business logic in clients**: Clients become bloated and hard to test. Keep clients as thin wrappers around HTTP calls. Put business logic in middlewares or dedicated service functions.
- **Direct client instantiation**: Using `new MyClient(...)` inside a middleware creates clients without auth context, caching, or metrics. Always access via `ctx.clients`.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Are all HTTP calls going through `@vtex/api` clients (no axios, fetch, got)?
- [ ] Are all clients accessed via `ctx.clients`, never instantiated with `new`?
- [ ] Are custom clients registered in the IOClients class?
- [ ] Does the Service entry point correctly wire clients, routes, resolvers, and events?
- [ ] Is business logic in middlewares/resolvers, not in client classes?
- [ ] Does `service.json` have reasonable route count (≤10)?
- [ ] Are client options (retries, timeout) configured appropriately?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when designing vtex io configuration apps with the configuration builder or when a service app must receive structured configuration through runtime context. covers the separation between service apps and configuration apps, schema.json and configuration.json, settingstype, and reading injected configuration through ctx.vtex.settings. use for shared service configuration, decoupled configuration lifecycle, or reviewing whether app settings should be replaced by a configuration app.

# Service Configuration Apps

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when a VTEX IO service should receive structured configuration from another app through the `configuration` builder instead of relying only on local app settings.

- Creating a configuration app with the `configuration` builder
- Exposing configuration entrypoints from a service app
- Sharing one configuration contract across multiple services or apps
- Separating configuration lifecycle from runtime app lifecycle
- Reading injected configuration through `ctx.vtex.settings`

Do not use this skill for:
- simple app-local configuration managed only through `settingsSchema`
- Store Framework block settings through `contentSchemas.json`
- generic service runtime wiring unrelated to configuration
- policy design beyond the configuration-specific permissions required

## Decision rules

- Treat the service app and the configuration app as separate responsibilities.
- The service app owns runtime (`node`, `graphql`, etc.), declares the `configuration` builder in `manifest.json`, defines `configuration/schema.json`, and reads injected values through `ctx.vtex.settings`.
- The configuration app does not own the service runtime. It should not declare `node` or `graphql` builders and usually has only the `configuration` builder.
- The configuration app points to the target service in the `configuration` field and provides concrete values in `<service-app>/configuration.json`.
- Use a configuration app when the configuration contract should live independently from the app that consumes it.
- Prefer a configuration app when multiple apps or services need to share the same configuration model.
- In service apps, expose configuration entrypoints explicitly through `settingsType: "workspace"` in `node/service.json` routes or events, or through `@settings` in GraphQL when the service should receive configuration from a configuration app.
- In configuration apps, the folder name under `configuration/` and the key in the `configuration` field should match the target service app ID, for example `shipping-service` in `vendor.shipping-service`.
- The shape of `configuration.json` must respect the JSON Schema declared by the service app.
- Read received configuration from `ctx.vtex.settings` inside the service runtime instead of making your own HTTP call just to fetch those values.
- Handlers and resolvers should cast or validate `ctx.vtex.settings` to match the configuration schema and apply defaults consistent with that schema.
- Treat configuration apps as a way to inject structured runtime configuration through VTEX IO context, not as a replacement for arbitrary operational data storage.
- Use `settingsSchema` when configuration is local to one app and should be edited directly in Apps > App Settings. Use configuration apps when the contract should be shared, versioned, or decoupled from the consuming app lifecycle.
- If a service configured through a configuration app fails to resolve workspace app configuration due to permissions, explicitly evaluate whether the manifest needs the `read-workspace-apps` policy for that scenario. Do not add this policy by default to unrelated services.
- For service configuration contracts, prefer closed schemas with `additionalProperties: false` and use `definitions` plus `$ref` when the structure becomes more complex.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Service apps must explicitly opt in to receiving configuration

A service app MUST declare where configuration can be injected, using `settingsType: "workspace"` in `node/service.json` routes or events, or the `@settings` directive in GraphQL.

**Why this matters**

Configuration apps do not magically apply to all service entrypoints. The service must explicitly mark which routes, events, or queries resolve runtime configuration.

**Detection**

If a service is expected to receive configuration but its routes, events, or GraphQL queries do not declare `settingsType` or `@settings`, STOP and expose the configuration boundary first.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "status": {
      "path": "/_v/status/:code",
      "public": true,
      "settingsType": "workspace"
    }
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "status": {
      "path": "/_v/status/:code",
      "public": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Constraint: Configuration shape must be defined with explicit schema files

Configuration apps and the services they configure MUST use explicit schema files instead of implicit or undocumented payloads.

**Why this matters**

Without `configuration/schema.json` and matching `configuration.json` contracts, shared configuration becomes ambiguous and error-prone across apps.

**Detection**

If a configuration app is introduced without a clear schema file or the service accepts loosely defined configuration payloads, STOP and define the schema first.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$ref": "#/definitions/ServiceConfiguration",
  "definitions": {
    "ServiceConfiguration": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "bank": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "account": { "type": "string" },
            "workspace": { "type": "string", "default": "master" },
            "version": { "type": "string" },
            "kycVersion": { "type": "string" },
            "payoutVersion": { "type": "string" },
            "host": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "required": ["account", "version", "kycVersion", "payoutVersion", "host"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      },
      "required": ["bank"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

### Constraint: Consuming apps must read injected configuration from runtime context, not by inventing extra fetches

When a service is configured through a configuration app, it MUST consume the injected values from `ctx.vtex.settings` instead of creating its own ad hoc HTTP call just to retrieve the same configuration.

**Why this matters**

The purpose of configuration apps is to let VTEX IO inject the structured configuration directly into service context. Adding a custom fetch layer on top creates unnecessary complexity and loses the main runtime advantage of the builder.

**Detection**

If a service already exposes `settingsType` or `@settings` but still performs its own backend fetch to retrieve the same configuration, STOP and move the read to `ctx.vtex.settings`.

**Correct**

```typescript
export async function handleStatus(ctx: Context) {
  const settings = ctx.vtex.settings
  const code = ctx.vtex.route.params.code

  const status = resolveStatus(code, settings)
  ctx.body = { status }
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
export async function handleStatus(ctx: Context) {
  const settings = await ctx.clients.partnerApi.getSettings()
  ctx.body = settings
}
```

## Preferred pattern

Model the service and the configuration app as separate contracts:

1. The service app exposes where configuration can be resolved.
2. The service app defines accepted structure in `configuration/schema.json`.
3. The configuration app declares the service as a builder and supplies values in `configuration.json`.
4. The service reads the injected configuration through `ctx.vtex.settings`.

Example: service app `vendor.shipping-service`

`manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "vendor": "vendor",
  "name": "shipping-service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x",
    "configuration": "1.x"
  }
}
```

`configuration/schema.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$ref": "#/definitions/ShippingConfiguration",
  "definitions": {
    "ShippingConfiguration": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "carrierApi": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "baseUrl": { "type": "string" },
            "apiKey": { "type": "string", "format": "password" },
            "timeoutMs": { "type": "integer", "default": 3000 }
          },
          "required": ["baseUrl", "apiKey"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      },
      "required": ["carrierApi"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}
```

Example: configuration app `vendor.shipping-config`

`manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "vendor": "vendor",
  "name": "shipping-config",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "builders": {
    "configuration": "1.x"
  },
  "configuration": {
    "shipping-service": "1.x"
  }
}
```

`configuration/shipping-service/configuration.json`:

```json
{
  "carrierApi": {
    "baseUrl": "https://api.carrier.com",
    "apiKey": "secret-api-key-here",
    "timeoutMs": 5000
  }
}
```

Example: Node service consuming injected configuration

```typescript
export async function createShipment(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const settings = ctx.vtex.settings as {
    carrierApi: {
      baseUrl: string
      apiKey: string
      timeoutMs?: number
    }
  }

  const timeoutMs = settings.carrierApi.timeoutMs ?? 3000

  const response = await ctx.clients.carrier.createShipment({
    baseUrl: settings.carrierApi.baseUrl,
    apiKey: settings.carrierApi.apiKey,
    timeoutMs,
    payload: ctx.state.shipmentPayload,
  })

  ctx.body = response
  await next()
}
```

Example: GraphQL query using `@settings`

```graphql
type ShippingStatus {
  orderId: ID!
  status: String!
}

type Query {
  shippingStatus(orderId: ID!): ShippingStatus
    @settings(type: "workspace")
}
```

```typescript
export const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    shippingStatus: async (_: unknown, args: { orderId: string }, ctx: Context) => {
      const settings = ctx.vtex.settings as {
        carrierApi: { baseUrl: string; apiKey: string }
      }

      return ctx.clients.carrier.getStatus({
        baseUrl: settings.carrierApi.baseUrl,
        apiKey: settings.carrierApi.apiKey,
        orderId: args.orderId,
      })
    },
  },
}
```

Minimum working checklist for service configuration apps:

- [ ] The service app declares the `configuration` builder in `manifest.json`.
- [ ] The service app defines a valid `configuration/schema.json`.
- [ ] The configuration app provides `<service-app>/configuration.json` with values compatible with the schema.
- [ ] Service routes or events that need configuration declare `settingsType: "workspace"`.
- [ ] When the flow depends on workspace app resolution, the service manifest evaluates whether `read-workspace-apps` is required.

Use this approach when configuration should be shared, versioned, and injected by VTEX IO runtime rather than fetched ad hoc by service code.

## Common failure modes

- Using app settings when the real need is a shared configuration contract across apps.
- Creating configuration apps without explicit schema files.
- Forgetting `settingsType` or `@settings` in the service that should receive configuration.
- Fetching configuration over HTTP even though it is already injected in `ctx.vtex.settings`.
- Treating configuration apps as general-purpose operational storage.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is a configuration app really needed instead of plain `settingsSchema`?
- [ ] Could this case be solved with local app settings and `settingsSchema` instead of a separate configuration app?
- [ ] Does the service explicitly opt in to configuration resolution with `settingsType` or `@settings`?
- [ ] When configuration is injected through service routes or events, is `settingsType: "workspace"` declared where needed?
- [ ] Is the configuration contract defined through `configuration/schema.json` and matched by `configuration.json`?
- [ ] Does the service read configuration from `ctx.vtex.settings` instead of inventing extra fetches?
- [ ] If the flow depends on reading installed workspace apps or their configuration, was `read-workspace-apps` evaluated intentionally instead of added by default?
- [ ] Does the configuration schema stay closed and explicit enough for a shared contract?
- [ ] Is the configuration contract clearly separate from operational data storage?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when defining service.json routes, choosing public vs segment vs private url prefixes for vtex io services, or setting http cache headers that interact with the vtex edge and cdn. covers path patterns, cookie visibility, edge caching behavior, and aligning cache-control with data sensitivity. use for node or .net io backends where request path and response headers determine cdn safety.

# VTEX IO service paths and CDN behavior

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when you define or change **`service.json` routes** for a VTEX IO backend and need the edge (CDN) to pass the **right cookies** and apply the **right caching** for that endpoint’s data.

- Choosing between **public**, **segment** (`/_v/segment/...`), and **private** (`/_v/private/...`) path prefixes for a route
- Setting **`Cache-Control`** (and related headers) on HTTP responses so **public** cache behavior matches **data scope** (anonymous vs segment vs authenticated shopper)
- Explaining why a route **does not** receive `vtex_session` or `vtex_segment` cookies
- Troubleshooting **CloudFront** or edge behavior when cookies are missing (see official troubleshooting)

Do not use this skill for:

- Application-level LRU caches, VBase, or stale-while-revalidate orchestration → use **vtex-io-application-performance**
- GraphQL field-level `@cacheControl` only → use **vtex-io-graphql-api** alongside this skill

## Decision rules

- Paths are declared in **`service.json`** under `routes`. The **prefix** you choose (`/yourPath`, `/_v/segment/yourPath`, `/_v/private/yourPath`) controls **cookie forwarding** and **whether VTEX may cache the service response at the edge**—see the [Service path patterns](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/service-path-patterns) table.
- **Public** (`{yourPath}`): **No guarantee** the app receives request cookies. The edge **may cache** responses when possible. Use for **non-user-specific** data (e.g. static reference data that is safe to share across shoppers).
- **Segment** (`/_v/segment/{yourPath}`): The app receives **`vtex_segment`**. The edge caches **per segment**. Use when the response depends on **segment** (currency, region, sales channel, etc.) but **not** on authenticated identity.
- **Private** (`/_v/private/{yourPath}`): The app receives **`vtex_segment`** and **`vtex_session`**. The edge **does not cache** the service response. Use for **identity- or session-scoped** data (orders, addresses, profile).
- **`Cache-Control` on responses** must align with **classification**: never signal **CDN/shared cache** for payloads that embed **secrets**, **per-user** data, or **authorization** decisions unless the contract is explicitly designed for that (e.g. immutable public assets). When in doubt, prefer **private paths** and **no-store / private** cache directives for shopper-specific JSON.
- Read [Sessions System overview](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/sessions-system-overview) for how cookies relate to paths and sessions.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Do not use a public or segment-cached path for private or auth-scoped payloads

Routes that return **authenticated shopper data**, **PII**, or **authorization-sensitive** JSON **must not** rely on **public** paths or **edge-cached** responses that could serve one user’s data to another.

**Why this matters** — The edge may cache or route without the session context you expect; misclassified data can leak across users or segments.

**Detection** — A route under a **public** path returns **order history**, **addresses**, **tokens**, or **account-specific** fields; or **`Cache-Control`** suggests long-lived public caching for such payloads.

**Correct** — Use `/_v/private/...` for the route (or a pattern that receives `vtex_session`), and set **appropriate** `Cache-Control` (e.g. `private, no-store` for JSON APIs that are not cacheable). Note: the **path prefix** (`/_v/private/`) controls **CDN and cookie** behavior; the `"public": true` field controls **whether VTEX auth tokens are required** to call the route—these are **orthogonal**.

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "myOrders": {
      "path": "/_v/private/my-app/orders",
      "public": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Wrong** — Exposing `GET /my-app/orders` as a **public** path (no `/_v/private/` or `/_v/segment/` prefix) and returning **per-user** JSON while **assuming** the browser session is always visible to the service.

## Preferred pattern

1. **Classify the response** (anonymous, segment, authenticated) **before** picking the path prefix.
2. **Map** to **public** / **segment** / **private** per [Service path patterns](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/service-path-patterns).
3. **Set** response headers **explicitly** where the platform allows: align **`Cache-Control`** with the same classification (public immutable vs private vs no-store).
4. **Document** any path that must stay **private** for security or compliance so storefronts and BFFs do not link-cache it incorrectly.

## Common failure modes

- **Assuming cookies on public routes** — Services do not reliably receive `vtex_session` on public paths; identity logic fails intermittently.
- **Caching personalized JSON at the edge** — Long `max-age` on user-specific responses without `private` path + correct cache policy.
- **Mixing concerns** — One route returns both **public catalog** and **private account** data; split endpoints or use **private** + server-side auth checks.
- **Ignoring segment** — Price or promo that varies by **currency** or **segment** is served on a **public** path and **cached** for the wrong segment.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is each route’s **path prefix** (`public` / `/_v/segment` / `/_v/private`) justified by **cookie** and **Caching behavior** in the official table?
- [ ] For **shopper-specific** or **auth** responses, is the route **private** (or otherwise protected) and **not** edge-cacheable inappropriately?
- [ ] Do **`Cache-Control`** (and related) headers **match** data sensitivity?
- [ ] Are **parallel** calls from the client using the **correct** path for each payload type?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when designing or implementing the runtime structure of a vtex io backend app under node/. covers the service entrypoint, typed context and state, service.json runtime configuration, and how routes, events, and graphql handlers are registered and executed. use for structuring backend apps, defining runtime boundaries, or fixing execution-model issues in vtex io services.

# Service Runtime & Execution Model

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when the main decision is how a VTEX IO backend app runs inside the `node` builder: how the `Service` entrypoint is structured, how runtime configuration is declared, and how routes, events, or GraphQL handlers are registered into the service.

- Creating a new backend app under `node/`
- Structuring `node/index.ts` as the service entrypoint
- Defining typed `Context`, `State`, and params contracts for handlers
- Configuring `service.json` for timeout, memory, workers, and replicas
- Troubleshooting runtime issues caused by service registration or execution model mismatches
- Registering GraphQL handlers at the runtime level, while keeping schema and resolver design in a separate skill

Do not use this skill for:
- deciding the app contract in `manifest.json`
- designing custom clients or integration transport layers
- detailed HTTP route handler behavior
- event-specific business workflows
- GraphQL schema or resolver modeling beyond runtime registration

## Decision rules

- Treat `node/index.ts` as the runtime composition root of the backend app.
- Use the `Service` definition to register runtime surfaces such as routes, events, and GraphQL handlers, not to hold business logic directly.
- Keep runtime wiring explicit: context typing, client typing, route registration, and event registration should be visible at the service boundary.
- Put execution knobs such as timeout, ttl, memory, workers, and replica limits in `service.json`, not inside handler code.
- Use `service.json` to declare the runtime parameters the platform uses to execute the service, especially `memory`, `timeout`, `ttl`, `minReplicas`, `maxReplicas`, `workers`, `routes`, `events`, and `rateLimitPerReplica`.
- Use `routes` in `service.json` to expose HTTP entrypoints. Routes are private by default, so set `public: true` explicitly for routes that must be externally reachable.
- Use `smartcache: true` only on idempotent, cacheable routes where the same response can be safely reused across repeated requests. Avoid it on personalized, authenticated, or write-oriented endpoints.
- Use `events` in `service.json` to declare which event sources and handlers are part of the service runtime. Keep event registration in the runtime layer and event-specific business rules in dedicated event modules.
- Use `rateLimitPerReplica` to shape throughput per replica for requests and events. Set a global baseline only when the service needs it, then add small explicit overrides only for expensive routes or noisy event sources.
- Do not use `rateLimitPerReplica` as a substitute for redesigning expensive routes, queueing work, or moving slow operations to async processing.
- Keep handlers focused on request or event behavior; keep runtime structure focused on bootstrapping and registration.
- Model `Context`, `State`, and params types deliberately so middlewares and handlers share a stable contract. Apply the same typed `Context` and `State` to middlewares so they can safely manipulate `ctx.state`, `ctx.vtex`, and params without falling back to `any`.
- If a backend app starts mixing runtime wiring, client implementation, and business rules in the same file, split those concerns before expanding the service further.
- Although some authorization fields such as `routes.access` or `routes.policies` may live in `service.json`, they are primarily authorization concerns and belong in auth or security-focused skills rather than this runtime skill.

Runtime sizing heuristics:

- These ranges are intended for partner and account-level apps. Native VTEX core services may legitimately use much higher values such as thousands of MB of memory or hundreds of replicas, but those values should not be used as defaults for custom apps.

Suggested defaults:

- Start synchronous HTTP services with `timeout` between 10 and 30 seconds. For UX-facing routes, prefer 5 to 15 seconds.
- Start `memory` at 256 MB.
- Start `workers` at 1.
- Use `minReplicas: 2` as the default for installed apps, and reserve `minReplicas: 1` for linked-app development contexts where the platform allows it.
- Use `maxReplicas: 5` as the lowest practical starting point, since the documented minimum is `5`.
- Use `ttl` intentionally. In VTEX IO, `ttl` is measured in minutes, with platform defaults and limits that differ from `timeout`. For partner apps, start from the default `10` minutes and increase intentionally up to `60` only when reducing cold starts matters more than allowing idle instances to sleep sooner.

Scaling ranges and exceptions:

- Use 128 to 256 MB for simpler IO-bound services, and move to 512 MB only when there is evidence of OOM, large payload processing, or heavier libraries.
- Increase `workers` to 2 to 4 only for high-throughput IO-bound workloads after measuring benefit. Avoid using more than 4 workers per instance as a default.
- Increase `maxReplicas` from `5` toward `10` only when public traffic or predictable peaks justify it. Treat values above 10 as exceptions that require explicit justification and monitoring in partner apps.
- Avoid `timeout` values above 60 seconds for HTTP routes; if more time is needed, redesign the flow as async work.
- Remember that `ttl` has a documented minimum of `10` minutes and maximum of `60` minutes. Use higher values intentionally to reduce cold starts on low-traffic or bursty services, and avoid treating `ttl` like a per-request timeout.
- For partner apps, `rateLimitPerReplica.perMinute` often starts in the `60` to `300` range for normal routes and in the `10` to `60` range for more expensive ones. `rateLimitPerReplica.concurrent` often starts between `1` and `5`.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: The Service entrypoint must stay a runtime composition root

`node/index.ts` MUST define and export the VTEX IO service runtime structure, not become a catch-all file for business logic, data transformation, or transport implementation.

**Why this matters**

When the entrypoint mixes registration with business logic, the execution model becomes harder to reason about, handlers become tightly coupled, and changes to routes, events, or GraphQL surfaces become risky.

**Detection**

If `node/index.ts` contains large handler bodies, external API calls, complex branching, or data-mapping logic, STOP and move that logic into dedicated modules. Keep the entrypoint focused on typing and registration.

**Correct**

```typescript
import type { ClientsConfig, RecorderState, ServiceContext } from '@vtex/api'
import { Service } from '@vtex/api'
import { clients, Clients } from './clients'
import { routes } from './routes'

export interface State extends RecorderState {}

export type Context = ServiceContext<Clients, State>

const clientsConfig: ClientsConfig<Clients> = {
  implementation: clients,
  options: {},
}

export default new Service<Clients, State>({
  clients: clientsConfig,
  routes,
})
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
import { Service } from '@vtex/api'
import axios from 'axios'

export default new Service({
  routes: {
    reviews: async (ctx: any) => {
      const response = await axios.get('https://example.com/data')
      const transformed = response.data.items.map((item: any) => ({
        ...item,
        extra: true,
      }))

      ctx.body = transformed.filter((item: any) => item.active)
    },
  },
})
```

### Constraint: Runtime configuration must be expressed in `service.json`, not improvised in code

Resource and execution settings such as timeout, ttl, memory, workers, and replica behavior MUST be configured in `service.json` when the app depends on them.
`service.json` resides inside the `node/` folder and centralizes runtime parameters such as routes, events, memory, timeout, ttl, workers, replicas, and rate limits for this service.

**Why this matters**

These settings are part of the service runtime contract with the platform. Hiding them in assumptions or spreading them across code makes behavior harder to predict and can cause timeouts, cold-start churn, underprovisioning, or scaling mismatches. In VTEX IO, `ttl` is especially important because it is measured in minutes and influences how aggressively service infrastructure can go idle between requests.
Using the minimum `ttl` on low-traffic services can increase cold starts, because the platform is allowed to scale the service down more aggressively between bursts.

**Detection**

If the app depends on long-running work, concurrency, warm capacity, or specific route exposure behavior, STOP and verify that the relevant `service.json` settings are present and intentional. If the behavior is only implied in code comments or handler logic, move it into runtime configuration.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "memory": 256,
  "timeout": 30,
  "ttl": 10,
  "minReplicas": 2,
  "maxReplicas": 10,
  "workers": 4,
  "rateLimitPerReplica": {
    "perMinute": 300,
    "concurrent": 10
  },
  "routes": {
    "reviews": {
      "path": "/_v/api/reviews",
      "public": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "reviews": {
      "path": "/_v/api/reviews"
    }
  }
}
```

This runtime configuration is incomplete for a service that depends on explicit timeout, concurrency, rate limiting, or replica behavior, and it leaves execution characteristics undefined.

### Constraint: Route exposure must be explicit in the runtime contract

Every HTTP route exposed by the service MUST be declared in `service.json` with an intentional visibility choice. Do not rely on implicit defaults when the route should be private or public.
Routes are private by default, so always set `public: true` explicitly when the route must be externally reachable.

**Why this matters**

Route visibility is part of the runtime contract of the service. If exposure is ambiguous, a route can be published with the wrong accessibility, which creates security risk for private handlers and integration failures for routes expected to be public.

**Detection**

If a route exists in the service runtime, STOP and verify that it is declared in `service.json` and that `public` matches the intended exposure. If the route is consumed only by trusted backoffice or app-to-app flows, default to checking that it is private before expanding access.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "status": {
      "path": "/_v/status/health",
      "public": true,
      "smartcache": true
    },
    "reviews": {
      "path": "/_v/api/reviews",
      "public": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "reviews": {
      "path": "/_v/api/reviews"
    }
  }
}
```

This route leaves visibility implicit, so the runtime contract does not clearly communicate whether the endpoint is meant to be public or protected.

### Constraint: Typed context and state must match the handlers registered in the runtime

The service MUST define `Context`, `State`, and handler contracts that match the routes, events, or GraphQL handlers it registers.

**Why this matters**

Untyped or inconsistent runtime contracts make middleware composition fragile and allow handlers to rely on state or params that are never guaranteed to exist.

**Detection**

If middlewares or handlers use `ctx.state`, `ctx.clients`, `ctx.vtex`, or params fields without a shared typed contract, STOP and introduce or fix the runtime types before adding more handlers.

**Correct**

```typescript
import type { ParamsContext, RecorderState, ServiceContext } from '@vtex/api'

interface State extends RecorderState {
  reviewId?: string
}

type CustomContext = ServiceContext<Clients, State, ParamsContext>

export async function getReview(ctx: CustomContext) {
  ctx.state.reviewId = ctx.vtex.route.params.id
  ctx.body = { id: ctx.state.reviewId }
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
export async function getReview(ctx: any) {
  ctx.state.reviewId = ctx.params.review
  ctx.body = { id: ctx.state.missingField.value }
}
```

## Preferred pattern

Recommended file layout:

```text
node/
├── index.ts
├── clients/
│   └── index.ts
├── routes/
│   └── index.ts
├── events/
│   └── index.ts
├── graphql/
│   └── index.ts
└── middlewares/
    └── validate.ts
```

Minimal service runtime pattern:

```typescript
import type { ClientsConfig, RecorderState, ServiceContext } from '@vtex/api'
import { Service } from '@vtex/api'
import { clients, Clients } from './clients'
import { routes } from './routes'

export interface State extends RecorderState {}

export type Context = ServiceContext<Clients, State>

const clientsConfig: ClientsConfig<Clients> = {
  implementation: clients,
  options: {},
}

export default new Service<Clients, State>({
  clients: clientsConfig,
  routes,
})
```

Minimal `service.json` pattern:

```json
{
  "memory": 256,
  "timeout": 30,
  "ttl": 10,
  "minReplicas": 2,
  "maxReplicas": 5,
  "workers": 1,
  "rateLimitPerReplica": {
    "perMinute": 120,
    "concurrent": 4
  },
  "routes": {
    "status": {
      "path": "/_v/status/health",
      "public": true,
      "smartcache": true
    },
    "reviews": {
      "path": "/_v/api/reviews",
      "public": false
    }
  },
  "events": {
    "orderCreated": {
      "sender": "vtex.orders-broadcast",
      "topics": ["order-created"],
      "rateLimitPerReplica": {
        "perMinute": 60,
        "concurrent": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use the service entrypoint to compose runtime surfaces, then push business behavior into handlers, clients, and other focused modules.
If `routes/index.ts` or `events/index.ts` grows too large, split it by domain such as `routes/orders.ts` or `events/catalog.ts` and keep the index file as a small registry.

## Common failure modes

- Putting business logic directly into `node/index.ts`.
- Treating `service.json` as optional when runtime behavior depends on explicit resource settings.
- Setting `ttl` too low and causing the service to sleep too aggressively between bursts of traffic.
- Enabling `smartcache` on personalized or write-oriented routes and risking incorrect cache reuse across requests.
- Registering routes, events, or GraphQL handlers without a clear typed `Context` and `State`.
- Mixing runtime composition with client implementation details.
- Letting one service entrypoint accumulate unrelated responsibilities across HTTP, events, and GraphQL without clear module boundaries.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is `node/index.ts` acting as a runtime composition root rather than a business-logic file?
- [ ] Are routes, events, and GraphQL handlers registered explicitly and cleanly?
- [ ] Does `service.json` express the runtime behavior the app actually depends on?
- [ ] Are `Context`, `State`, and params types shared consistently across handlers?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when building or debugging a vtex io session transform app (vtex.session integration). covers namespace ownership, input-vs-output fields, transform ordering (dag), public-as-input vs private-as-read model, cross-namespace propagation, configuration.json contracts, caching inside transforms, and frontend session consumption. use when designing session-derived state for b2b, pricing, regionalization, or custom storefront context.

# VTEX IO session transform apps

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when your VTEX IO app integrates with the **VTEX session system** (`vtex.session`) to **derive**, **compute**, or **propagate** state that downstream transforms, the storefront, or checkout depend on.

- Building a **session transform** that computes custom fields from upstream session state (e.g. pricing context from an external backend, regionalization from org data)
- Declaring **input/output** fields in `vtex.session/configuration.json`
- Deciding which **namespace** your app should own and which it should **read from**
- Propagating values into **`public.*`** inputs so **native** transforms (profile, search, checkout) re-run
- Debugging **stale** session fields, **race conditions**, or **namespace collisions** between apps
- Designing **B2B** session flows where `storefront-permissions`, custom transforms, and checkout interact

Do not use this skill for:

- General IO backend patterns (use `vtex-io-service-apps`)
- Performance patterns outside session transforms (use `vtex-io-application-performance`)
- GraphQL schema or resolver design (use `vtex-io-graphql-api`)

## Decision rules

### Namespace ownership

- **Every session app owns exactly one output namespace** (or a small set of fields within one). The namespace name typically matches the app concept (e.g. `rona`, `myapp`, `storefront-permissions`).
- **Never write to another app's output namespace.** If `storefront-permissions` owns `storefront-permissions.organization`, your transform must **not** overwrite it—read it as an input instead.
- **Never duplicate** VTEX-owned fields (org, cost center, postal, country) into your namespace when they already exist in `storefront-permissions`, `profile`, `checkout`, or `store`. Your namespace should contain **only** data that comes from **your** backend or computation.

### `public` is input, private is read model

- **`public.*`** fields are an **input surface**: values the shopper or a flow sets so session transforms can run (e.g. geolocation, flags, UTMs, user intent). Do **not** treat `public.*` as the canonical read model in storefront code.
- **Private namespaces** (`profile`, `checkout`, `store`, `search`, `storefront-permissions`, your custom namespace) are the **read model**: computed outputs derived from inputs. Frontend components should read **private** namespace fields for business rules and display.
- If your transform must influence native apps (e.g. set a postal code derived from a cost center address), **update `public.*` input fields** that native apps declare as inputs—so the platform re-runs those upstream transforms and private outputs stay consistent. This is **input propagation**, not duplicating truth.

### Transform ordering (DAG)

- VTEX session runs transforms in a **directed acyclic graph** (DAG) based on declared input/output dependencies in each app's `vtex.session/configuration.json`.
- A transform runs when any of its **declared input fields** change. If you depend on `storefront-permissions.costcenter`, your transform runs **after** `storefront-permissions` outputs that field.
- **Order your dependencies carefully**: if your transform needs both `storefront-permissions` outputs and `profile` outputs, declare both as inputs so the platform schedules you after both.

### Caching inside transforms

- Session transforms execute on **every session change** that touches a declared input. They must be **fast**.
- Use **LRU** (in-process, per-worker) for hot lookups (org data, configuration, tokens) with short TTLs.
- Use **VBase stale-while-revalidate** for data that can tolerate brief staleness (external backend responses, computed mappings). Return stale immediately; revalidate in the background.
- Follow the same tenant-keying rules as any IO service: in-memory cache keys must include **`account`** and **`workspace`** (see `vtex-io-application-performance`).

### Frontend session consumption

- Storefront components should **request specific session items** via the `items=` query parameter (e.g. `items=rona.storeNumber,storefront-permissions.costcenter`).
- **Read** from the relevant **private** namespaces (`rona.*`, `storefront-permissions.*`, `profile.*`, etc.) for canonical state.
- **Write** to `public.*` only when setting **user intent** (e.g. selecting a location, switching a flag). Never write to `public.*` as a "cache" for values that private namespaces already provide.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Do not duplicate another app's output namespace fields into your namespace

Your session transform must output **only** fields that come from **your** computation or backend. Copying identity, address, or org fields that `storefront-permissions`, `profile`, or `checkout` already own creates **two sources of truth** that diverge on partial failures.

**Why this matters** — When two namespaces contain the same fact (e.g. `costCenterId` in both your namespace and `storefront-permissions`), consumers read inconsistent values after a session that partially updated. Debug time skyrockets and race conditions appear.

**Detection** — Your transform's output includes fields like `organization`, `costcenter`, `postalCode`, `country` that mirror `storefront-permissions.*` or `profile.*` outputs. Or frontend reads the same logical field from two different namespaces.

**Correct** — Read `storefront-permissions.costcenter` as an input; use it to compute your backend-specific fields (e.g. `myapp.priceTable`, `myapp.storeNumber`); output **only** those derived fields.

```json
{
  "my-session-app": {
    "input": {
      "storefront-permissions": ["costcenter", "organization"]
    },
    "output": {
      "myapp": ["priceTable", "storeNumber"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Wrong** — Output duplicates of VTEX-owned fields.

```json
{
  "my-session-app": {
    "output": {
      "myapp": ["costcenter", "organization", "postalCode", "priceTable", "storeNumber"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Constraint: Use input propagation to influence native transforms, not direct overwrites

When your transform derives a value (e.g. postal code from a cost center address) that native apps consume, set it as an **input** field those apps declare (typically `public.postalCode`, `public.country`)—**not** by writing directly to `checkout.postalCode` or `search.postalCode`.

**Why this matters** — Native transforms expect their **input** fields to change so they can recompute their **output** fields. Writing directly to their output namespaces bypasses recomputation and leaves stale derived state (e.g. `regionId` not updated, checkout address inconsistent).

**Detection** — Your transform declares output fields in namespaces owned by other apps (e.g. `output: { checkout: [...] }` or `output: { search: [...] }`). Or you PATCH session with values in a namespace you don't own.

**Correct** — Declare output in `public` for fields that native apps consume as inputs, verified against each native app's `vtex.session/configuration.json`.

```json
{
  "my-session-app": {
    "output": {
      "myapp": ["storeNumber", "priceTable"],
      "public": ["postalCode", "country", "state"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Wrong** — Writing to search or checkout output namespaces directly.

```json
{
  "my-session-app": {
    "output": {
      "myapp": ["storeNumber", "priceTable"],
      "checkout": ["postalCode", "country"],
      "search": ["facets"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Constraint: Frontend must read private namespaces, not `public`, for canonical business state

Storefront components and middleware must read session data from the **authoritative private namespace** (e.g. `storefront-permissions.organization`, `profile.email`, `myapp.priceTable`), not from `public.*` fields.

**Why this matters** — `public.*` fields are inputs that may be stale, user-set, or partial. Private namespace fields are the **computed** truth after all transforms have run. Reading `public.postalCode` instead of the profile- or checkout-derived value leads to displaying stale or inconsistent data.

**Detection** — React components or middleware that read `public.storeNumber`, `public.organization`, or `public.costCenter` for display or business logic instead of the corresponding private field.

**Correct**

```typescript
// Read from the authoritative namespace
const { data } = useSessionItems([
  'myapp.storeNumber',
  'myapp.priceTable',
  'storefront-permissions.costcenter',
  'storefront-permissions.organization',
])
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
// Reading from public as if it were the source of truth
const { data } = useSessionItems([
  'public.storeNumber',
  'public.organization',
  'public.costCenter',
])
```

## Preferred pattern

### `vtex.session/configuration.json`

Declare your transform's input dependencies and output fields:

```json
{
  "my-session-app": {
    "input": {
      "storefront-permissions": ["costcenter", "organization", "costCenterAddressId"]
    },
    "output": {
      "myapp": ["storeNumber", "priceTable"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Transform handler

```typescript
// node/handlers/transform.ts
export async function transform(ctx: Context) {
  const { costcenter, organization } = parseSfpInputs(ctx.request.body)

  if (!costcenter) {
    ctx.body = { myapp: {} }
    return
  }

  const costCenterData = await getCostCenterCached(ctx, costcenter)
  const pricing = await resolvePricing(ctx, costCenterData)

  ctx.body = {
    myapp: {
      storeNumber: pricing.storeNumber,
      priceTable: pricing.priceTable,
    },
  }
}
```

### Caching inside the transform

```typescript
// Two-layer cache: LRU (sub-ms) -> VBase (persistent, SWR) -> API
const costCenterLRU = new LRU<string, CostCenterData>({ max: 1000, ttl: 600_000 })

async function getCostCenterCached(ctx: Context, costCenterId: string) {
  const { account, workspace } = ctx.vtex
  const key = `${account}:${workspace}:${costCenterId}`

  const lruHit = costCenterLRU.get(key)
  if (lruHit) return lruHit

  const result = await staleFromVBaseWhileRevalidate(
    ctx.clients.vbase,
    'cost-centers',
    costCenterId,
    () => fetchCostCenterFromAPI(ctx, costCenterId),
    { ttlMs: 1_800_000 }
  )

  costCenterLRU.set(key, result)
  return result
}
```

### `service.json` route

```json
{
  "routes": {
    "transform": {
      "path": "/_v/my-session-app/session/transform",
      "public": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Session ecosystem awareness

When building a transform, map out the transform DAG for your store:

```text
authentication-session → impersonate-session → profile-session
profile-session → store-session → checkout-session
profile-session → search-session
authentication-session + checkout-session + impersonate-session → storefront-permissions
storefront-permissions → YOUR-TRANSFORM (reads SFP outputs)
```

Your transform sits at the **end** of whatever dependency chain it requires. Declaring inputs correctly ensures the platform schedules you **after** all upstream transforms.

## Common failure modes

- **Frontend writes B2B state via `updateSession`** — Instead of letting `storefront-permissions` + your transform compute B2B session fields, the frontend PATCHes them directly. This creates race conditions, partial state, and duplicated sources of truth.
- **Duplicating VTEX-owned fields** — Copying `costcenter`, `organization`, or `postalCode` into your namespace when they already live in `storefront-permissions` or `profile`.
- **Slow transforms without caching** — Calling external APIs on every transform invocation without LRU + VBase SWR. Transforms run on every session change that touches a declared input; they must be fast.
- **Reading `public.*` as source of truth** — Frontend components reading `public.organization` or `public.storeNumber` instead of the private namespace field, leading to stale or inconsistent display.
- **Writing to other apps' output namespaces** — Declaring output fields in `checkout`, `search`, or `storefront-permissions` namespaces you don't own, bypassing native transform recomputation.
- **Missing tenant keys in LRU** — In-memory cache for org or pricing data keyed only by entity ID without `account:workspace`, unsafe on multi-tenant shared pods.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Does the transform output **only** fields from its own computation/backend, not duplicates of other namespaces?
- [ ] Are **input** dependencies declared correctly in `vtex.session/configuration.json`?
- [ ] Are **output** fields limited to your own namespace (plus `public.*` inputs when propagation is needed)?
- [ ] Is `public.*` used **only** for input propagation, not as a second read model?
- [ ] Do frontend components read from **private** namespaces, not `public.*`, for business state?
- [ ] Are upstream API calls in the transform **cached** (LRU + VBase SWR) to keep transform latency low?
- [ ] Are in-memory cache keys scoped with `account:workspace` for multi-tenant safety?
- [ ] Is the transform order (DAG) correct—does it run after all its dependency transforms?
- [ ] Has `updateSession` been removed from frontend code for fields the transform computes?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when building vtex io storefront components under react/ for store framework experiences. covers storefront component structure, css-handles, storefront context hooks, browser-safe data fetching, and how components should behave when used as theme blocks. use for custom storefront ui, product widgets, banners, forms, or reviewing shopper-facing react code in vtex io apps.

# Storefront React Components

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when building shopper-facing React components under the `react` builder for storefront experiences.

- Creating product or category UI widgets
- Building custom banners, forms, and shopper-facing layout pieces
- Using storefront hooks or context providers
- Styling components with css-handles

Do not use this skill for:
- admin pages
- block registration and render-runtime contracts
- service runtime or backend route design
- GraphQL schema design

## Decision rules

- Treat storefront components as browser-facing UI and keep them safe for shopper contexts.
- Prefer keeping storefront components presentational and props-driven, and move complex data fetching or business logic to hooks or container components.
- Use `vtex.css-handles` instead of hardcoded global class names.
- Prefer receiving data through props or documented storefront hooks and contexts such as `useProduct`, `useRuntime`, or `useOrderForm` instead of calling VTEX APIs directly from the browser or using app keys in storefront code.
- Keep components resilient to loading, empty, and unavailable product or search context.
- For shopper-facing copy, use message IDs and helpers from the messages infrastructure, as described in `vtex-io-messages-and-i18n`, instead of string literals.
- Treat storefront components as part of the storefront accessibility surface: use semantic HTML elements such as `button` or `a` instead of clickable `div`s, and ensure important content has appropriate labels or alternative text.
- When accessing browser globals such as `window` or `document`, guard against server-side execution, for example by using `useEffect` or checking `typeof window !== 'undefined'`.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Storefront styling must use css-handles

Storefront components MUST expose styling through `css-handles`, not arbitrary hardcoded class names.

**Why this matters**

css-handles are the customization contract for storefront components. Hardcoded or hidden class names make themes harder to extend safely.

**Detection**

If a storefront component uses arbitrary global class names without css-handles, STOP and expose styling through handles first.

**Correct**

```tsx
const CSS_HANDLES = ['container', 'title'] as const
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
return <div className="my-random-block-root">...</div>
```

### Constraint: Storefront components must remain browser-safe

Storefront React code MUST not depend on Node-only APIs or server-only assumptions.

**Why this matters**

These components run in the shopper-facing frontend. Server-only dependencies break rendering and create runtime failures in the browser.

**Detection**

If a component uses Node-only modules, filesystem access, or server runtime assumptions, STOP and redesign it for the browser.

**Correct**

```tsx
return <span>{label}</span>
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
import fs from 'fs'
```

### Constraint: Shopper-facing strings must be localizable

Visible storefront strings MUST use the app i18n pattern instead of hardcoded text.

**Why this matters**

Storefront UIs run across locales and stores. Hardcoded strings make the component less reusable and less consistent with VTEX IO localization.

**Detection**

If shopper-visible copy is hardcoded in JSX, STOP and move it to the i18n mechanism.

**Correct**

```tsx
<FormattedMessage id="storefront.cta" />
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
<span>Buy now</span>
```

## Preferred pattern

Keep storefront components small, props-driven, css-handle-based, and safe for shopper contexts.

Minimal css-handles pattern:

```tsx
import { useCssHandles } from 'vtex.css-handles'

const CSS_HANDLES = ['container', 'title'] as const

export function MyComponent() {
  const { handles } = useCssHandles(CSS_HANDLES)

  return (
    <div className={handles.container}>
      <h2 className={handles.title}>...</h2>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Common failure modes

- Hardcoding class names instead of using css-handles.
- Using browser-unsafe dependencies.
- Hardcoding shopper-visible strings.
- Fetching data in ad hoc ways instead of using VTEX storefront patterns.
- Putting complex business logic or heavy data fetching directly inside presentational components instead of using hooks or containers.
- Using non-semantic clickable elements such as `div` or `span` with `onClick` where a `button` or `a` element should be used.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is this component truly shopper-facing?
- [ ] Are styles exposed through css-handles?
- [ ] Is the component safe for browser execution?
- [ ] Are visible strings localized?
- [ ] Is the data flow appropriate for a storefront component?
