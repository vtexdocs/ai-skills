This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when creating or modifying manifest.json, service.json, or node/package.json in a vtex io app. covers builders (node, react, graphql, admin, pixel, messages, store), policy declarations, dependencies, peerdependencies, and app lifecycle management. use for scaffolding new vtex io apps, configuring builders, or fixing deployment failures related to app structure and naming conventions.

# App Architecture & Manifest Configuration

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when working with the foundational structure of a VTEX IO app — the `manifest.json` file, builder system, policy declarations, dependency management, `service.json` resource limits, and app lifecycle (link, publish, deploy).

- Creating a new VTEX IO app from scratch
- Adding a builder to an existing app
- Configuring policies for API access
- Troubleshooting deployment failures related to manifest misconfiguration

Do not use this skill for:

- Backend service implementation details (use `vtex-io-service-apps` instead)
- React component development (use `vtex-io-react-apps` instead)
- GraphQL schema and resolver details (use `vtex-io-graphql-api` instead)

## Decision rules

- Every VTEX IO app starts with `manifest.json` — it defines identity (`vendor`, `name`, `version`), builders, dependencies, and policies.
- Use the builder that matches the directory: `node` for `/node`, `react` for `/react`, `graphql` for `/graphql`, `admin` for `/admin`, `pixel` for `/pixel`, `messages` for `/messages`, `store` for `/store`, `masterdata` for `/masterdata`, `styles` for `/styles`.
- Declare policies for every external host your app calls and every VTEX Admin resource it accesses.
- Use `service.json` in `/node` to configure memory (max 512MB), timeout, autoscaling, and route definitions.
- Use semver ranges (`3.x`) for dependencies, not exact versions.
- Use `peerDependencies` for apps that must be present but should not be auto-installed.

Builders reference:

| Builder      | Directory     | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node`       | `/node`       | Backend services in TypeScript (middlewares, resolvers, event handlers) |
| `react`      | `/react`      | Frontend React components in TypeScript/TSX                             |
| `graphql`    | `/graphql`    | GraphQL schema definitions (`.graphql` files)                           |
| `admin`      | `/admin`      | Admin panel pages and navigation entries                                |
| `pixel`      | `/pixel`      | Pixel/tracking apps that inject scripts into the storefront             |
| `messages`   | `/messages`   | Internationalization — localized string files per locale                |
| `store`      | `/store`      | Store Framework theme blocks, interfaces, and routes                    |
| `masterdata` | `/masterdata` | Master Data v2 entity schemas and triggers                              |
| `styles`     | `/styles`     | CSS/Tachyons configuration for Store Framework themes                   |

Policy types:

1. **Outbound-access policies**: Grant access to explicit URLs (external APIs or VTEX endpoints).
2. **License Manager policies**: Grant access to VTEX Admin resources using resource keys.
3. **App role-based policies**: Grant access to routes or GraphQL queries exposed by other IO apps, using the format `{vendor}.{app-name}:{policy-name}`.

Architecture:

```text
manifest.json
├── builders → determines which directories are processed
│   ├── node/ → compiled by node builder → backend service
│   ├── react/ → compiled by react builder → frontend bundles
│   ├── graphql/ → compiled by graphql builder → schema/resolvers
│   ├── store/ → compiled by store builder → theme blocks
│   ├── admin/ → compiled by admin builder → admin pages
│   ├── pixel/ → compiled by pixel builder → tracking scripts
│   └── messages/ → compiled by messages builder → i18n strings
├── policies → runtime permissions for API access
├── dependencies → other VTEX IO apps this app requires
└── peerDependencies → apps required but not auto-installed
```

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Declare All Required Builders

Every directory in your app that contains processable code MUST have a corresponding builder declared in `manifest.json`. If you have a `/node` directory, the `node` builder MUST be declared. If you have a `/react` directory, the `react` builder MUST be declared.

**Why this matters**

Without the builder declaration, the VTEX IO platform ignores the directory entirely. Your backend code will not compile, your React components will not render, and your GraphQL schemas will not be registered. The app will link successfully but the functionality will silently be absent.

**Detection**

If you see backend TypeScript code in a `/node` directory but the manifest does not declare `"node": "7.x"` in `builders`, STOP and add the builder. Same applies to `/react` without `"react": "3.x"`, `/graphql` without `"graphql": "1.x"`, etc.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "name": "my-service-app",
  "vendor": "myvendor",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "title": "My Service App",
  "description": "A backend service app with GraphQL",
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x",
    "graphql": "1.x",
    "docs": "0.x"
  },
  "dependencies": {},
  "policies": []
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "name": "my-service-app",
  "vendor": "myvendor",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "title": "My Service App",
  "description": "A backend service app with GraphQL",
  "builders": {
    "docs": "0.x"
  },
  "dependencies": {},
  "policies": []
}
```

Missing "node" and "graphql" builders — the /node and /graphql directories will be completely ignored. Backend code won't compile, GraphQL schema won't be registered. The app links without errors but nothing works.

---

### Constraint: Declare Policies for All External Access

Every external API call or VTEX resource access MUST have a corresponding policy in `manifest.json`. This includes outbound HTTP calls to external hosts, VTEX Admin resource access, and consumption of other apps' GraphQL APIs.

**Why this matters**

VTEX IO sandboxes apps for security. Without the proper policy, any outbound HTTP request will be blocked at the infrastructure level, returning a `403 Forbidden` error. This is not a code issue — it is a platform-level restriction.

**Detection**

If you see code making API calls (via clients or HTTP) to a host, STOP and verify that an `outbound-access` policy exists for that host in the manifest. If you see `licenseManager.canAccessResource(...)`, verify a License Manager policy exists.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "outbound-access",
      "attrs": {
        "host": "api.vtex.com",
        "path": "/api/*"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "outbound-access",
      "attrs": {
        "host": "portal.vtexcommercestable.com.br",
        "path": "/api/*"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "ADMIN_DS"
    },
    {
      "name": "colossus-fire-event"
    },
    {
      "name": "colossus-write-logs"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "policies": []
}
```

Empty policies array while the app makes calls to api.vtex.com and uses Master Data. All outbound requests will fail at runtime with 403 Forbidden errors that are difficult to debug.

---

### Constraint: Follow App Naming Conventions

App names MUST be in kebab-case (lowercase letters separated by hyphens). The vendor MUST match the VTEX account name. Version MUST follow Semantic Versioning 2.0.0.

**Why this matters**

Apps with invalid names cannot be published to the VTEX App Store. Names with special characters or uppercase letters will be rejected by the builder-hub. Vendor mismatch prevents the account from managing the app.

**Detection**

If you see an app name with uppercase letters, underscores, special characters, or numbers at the beginning, STOP and fix the name.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "name": "order-status-dashboard",
  "vendor": "mycompany",
  "version": "2.1.3"
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "name": "Order_Status_Dashboard",
  "vendor": "mycompany",
  "version": "2.1"
}
```

Uppercase letters and underscores in the name will be rejected. Version "2.1" is not valid semver — must be "2.1.0".

## Preferred pattern

Initialize with the VTEX IO CLI:

```bash
vtex init
```

Select the appropriate template: `service-example`, `graphql-example`, `react-app-template`, or `store-theme`.

Recommended manifest configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "product-review-service",
  "vendor": "mycompany",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "title": "Product Review Service",
  "description": "Backend service for managing product reviews with GraphQL API",
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x",
    "graphql": "1.x",
    "docs": "0.x"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.search-graphql": "0.x"
  },
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "outbound-access",
      "attrs": {
        "host": "api.vtex.com",
        "path": "/api/*"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "ADMIN_DS"
    },
    {
      "name": "colossus-fire-event"
    },
    {
      "name": "colossus-write-logs"
    }
  ]
}
```

Recommended `service.json` for backend apps:

```json
{
  "memory": 256,
  "timeout": 30,
  "minReplicas": 2,
  "maxReplicas": 10,
  "workers": 4,
  "routes": {
    "reviews": {
      "path": "/_v/api/reviews",
      "public": false
    },
    "review-by-id": {
      "path": "/_v/api/reviews/:id",
      "public": false
    }
  }
}
```

Recommended directory structure:

```text
my-app/
├── manifest.json
├── package.json
├── node/
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json

        "title": "Reviews per page",
        "type": "number"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Common failure modes

- **Declaring unused builders**: Adding builders "just in case" creates overhead during the build process. Unused builder directories can cause build warnings. Only declare builders your app actively uses.
- **Wildcard outbound policies**: Using `"host": "*"` or `"path": "/*"` is a security risk, will be rejected during app review, and makes security audits difficult. Declare specific policies for each external service.
- **Hardcoding version in dependencies**: Pinning exact versions like `"vtex.store-components": "3.165.0"` prevents receiving bug fixes. Use major version ranges with `x` wildcard: `"vtex.store-components": "3.x"`.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Does every code directory (`/node`, `/react`, `/graphql`, etc.) have a matching builder in `manifest.json`?
- [ ] Are all external hosts and VTEX resources declared in `policies`?
- [ ] Is the app name kebab-case, vendor matching account, version valid semver?
- [ ] Does `service.json` exist for apps with the `node` builder?
- [ ] Are dependencies using major version ranges (`3.x`) instead of exact versions?
- [ ] Are placeholder values (vendor, app name, policies) replaced with real values?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when working with graphql schema files in graphql/ or implementing resolvers in node/resolvers/ for vtex io apps. covers schema.graphql definitions, @cachecontrol and @auth directives, custom type definitions, and resolver registration in the service class. use for exposing data through graphql queries and mutations with proper cache control and authentication enforcement.

# GraphQL Schemas & Resolvers

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when your VTEX IO app needs to expose a GraphQL API — either for frontend React components to query, for other VTEX IO apps to consume, or for implementing custom data aggregation layers over VTEX Commerce APIs.

- Defining schemas in `.graphql` files in the `/graphql` directory
- Writing resolver functions in TypeScript in `/node/resolvers/`
- Configuring `@cacheControl` and `@auth` directives
- Wiring resolvers into the Service class

Do not use this skill for:
- Backend service structure and client system (use `vtex-io-service-apps` instead)
- Manifest and builder configuration (use `vtex-io-app-structure` instead)
- MasterData integration details (use `vtex-io-masterdata` instead)

## Decision rules

- The `graphql` builder processes `.graphql` files in `/graphql` and merges them into a single schema.
- Split definitions across multiple files for maintainability: `schema.graphql` for root types, `directives.graphql` for directive declarations, `types/*.graphql` for custom types.
- Use `@cacheControl(scope: PUBLIC, maxAge: SHORT|MEDIUM|LONG)` on all public Query fields. `PUBLIC` = shared CDN cache, `PRIVATE` = per-user cache.
- Use `@auth` on all Mutations and on Queries that return sensitive or user-specific data.
- Never use `@cacheControl` on Mutations.
- Resolver function keys in the Service entry point MUST exactly match the field names in `schema.graphql`.
- Always use `ctx.clients` in resolvers for data access — never raw HTTP calls.

Recommended directory structure:

```text
graphql/
├── schema.graphql        # Query and Mutation root type definitions
├── directives.graphql    # Custom directive declarations (@cacheControl, @auth)
└── types/
    ├── Review.graphql    # Custom type definitions
    └── Product.graphql   # One file per type for organization
```

Built-in directives:
- **`@cacheControl`**: `scope` (`PUBLIC`/`PRIVATE`), `maxAge` (`SHORT` 30s, `MEDIUM` 5min, `LONG` 1h)
- **`@auth`**: Enforces valid VTEX authentication token. Without it, unauthenticated users can call the endpoint.
- **`@smartcache`**: Automatically caches query results in VTEX infrastructure.

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Declare the graphql Builder

Any app using `.graphql` schema files MUST declare the `graphql` builder in `manifest.json`. The `graphql` builder interprets the schema and registers it with the VTEX IO runtime.

**Why this matters**

Without the `graphql` builder declaration, the `/graphql` directory is completely ignored. Schema files will not be processed, resolvers will not be registered, and GraphQL queries will return "schema not found" errors. The app will link without errors but GraphQL will silently not work.

**Detection**

If you see `.graphql` files in a `/graphql` directory but the manifest does not include `"graphql": "1.x"` in `builders`, STOP and add the builder declaration.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x",
    "graphql": "1.x"
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x"
  }
}
```

Missing `"graphql": "1.x"` — the `/graphql` directory with schema files is ignored. GraphQL queries return errors because no schema is registered. The app links successfully, masking the problem.

---

### Constraint: Use @cacheControl on Public Queries

All public-facing Query fields (those fetching data that is not user-specific) MUST include the `@cacheControl` directive with an appropriate `scope` and `maxAge`. Mutations MUST NOT use `@cacheControl`.

**Why this matters**

Without `@cacheControl`, every query hits your resolver on every request — no CDN caching, no edge caching, no shared caching. This leads to unnecessary load on VTEX infrastructure, slow response times, and potential rate limiting. For public product data, caching is critical for performance.

**Detection**

If a Query field returns public data (not user-specific) and does not have `@cacheControl`, warn the developer to add it. If a Mutation has `@cacheControl`, STOP and remove it.

**Correct**

```graphql
type Query {
  reviews(productId: String!, limit: Int): [Review]
    @cacheControl(scope: PUBLIC, maxAge: SHORT)

  productMetadata(slug: String!): ProductMetadata
    @cacheControl(scope: PUBLIC, maxAge: MEDIUM)

  myReviews: [Review]
    @cacheControl(scope: PRIVATE, maxAge: SHORT)
    @auth
}

type Mutation {
  createReview(review: ReviewInput!): Review @auth
}
```

**Wrong**

```graphql
type Query {
  reviews(productId: String!, limit: Int): [Review]

  myReviews: [Review]
}

type Mutation {
  createReview(review: ReviewInput!): Review
    @cacheControl(scope: PUBLIC, maxAge: LONG)
}
```

No cache control on queries (every request hits the resolver), missing `@auth` on user-specific data, and `@cacheControl` on a mutation (makes no sense).

---

### Constraint: Resolver Names Must Match Schema Fields

Resolver function keys in the Service entry point MUST exactly match the field names defined in `schema.graphql`. The resolver object structure must mirror the GraphQL type hierarchy.

**Why this matters**

The GraphQL runtime maps incoming queries to resolver functions by name. If the resolver key does not match the schema field name, the field will resolve to `null` without any error — a silent failure that is extremely difficult to debug.

**Detection**

If a schema field has no matching resolver key (or vice versa), STOP. Cross-check every Query and Mutation field against the resolver registration in `node/index.ts`.

**Correct**

```graphql
type Query {
  reviews(productId: String!): [Review]
  reviewById(id: ID!): Review
}
```

```typescript
// node/index.ts — resolver keys match schema field names exactly
export default new Service({
  graphql: {
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        reviews: reviewsResolver,
        reviewById: reviewByIdResolver,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
// node/index.ts — resolver key "getReviews" does not match schema field "reviews"
export default new Service({
  graphql: {
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        getReviews: reviewsResolver,    // Wrong! Schema says "reviews", not "getReviews"
        getReviewById: reviewByIdResolver, // Wrong! Schema says "reviewById"
      },
    },
  },
})
```

Both fields will silently resolve to null. No error in logs.

## Preferred pattern

Add the GraphQL builder to manifest:

```json
{
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x",
    "graphql": "1.x"
  }
}
```

Define the schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  reviews(productId: String!, limit: Int, offset: Int): ReviewsResponse
    @cacheControl(scope: PUBLIC, maxAge: SHORT)

  review(id: ID!): Review
    @cacheControl(scope: PUBLIC, maxAge: SHORT)
}

type Mutation {
  createReview(input: ReviewInput!): Review @auth
  updateReview(id: ID!, input: ReviewInput!): Review @auth
  deleteReview(id: ID!): Boolean @auth
}
```

Define custom types:

```graphql
type Review {
  id: ID!
  productId: String!
  author: String!
  rating: Int!
  title: String!
  text: String!
  createdAt: String!
  approved: Boolean!
}

type ReviewsResponse {
  data: [Review!]!
  total: Int!
  hasMore: Boolean!
}

input ReviewInput {
  productId: String!
  rating: Int!
  title: String!
  text: String!
}
```

Declare directives:

```graphql
directive @cacheControl(
  scope: CacheControlScope
  maxAge: CacheControlMaxAge
) on FIELD_DEFINITION

enum CacheControlScope {
  PUBLIC
  PRIVATE
}

enum CacheControlMaxAge {
  SHORT
  MEDIUM
  LONG
}

directive @auth on FIELD_DEFINITION
directive @smartcache on FIELD_DEFINITION
```

Implement resolvers:

```typescript
// node/resolvers/reviews.ts
import type { ServiceContext } from '@vtex/api'
import type { Clients } from '../clients'

type Context = ServiceContext<Clients>

export const queries = {
  reviews: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: { productId: string; limit?: number; offset?: number },
    ctx: Context
  ) => {
    const { productId, limit = 10, offset = 0 } = args
    const reviews = await ctx.clients.masterdata.searchDocuments<Review>({
      dataEntity: 'reviews',
      fields: ['id', 'productId', 'author', 'rating', 'title', 'text', 'createdAt', 'approved'],
      where: `productId=${productId} AND approved=true`,
      pagination: { page: Math.floor(offset / limit) + 1, pageSize: limit },
      schema: 'review-schema-v1',
    })

    return {
      data: reviews,
      total: reviews.length,
      hasMore: reviews.length === limit,
    }
  },

  review: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: { id: string },
    ctx: Context
  ) => {
    return ctx.clients.masterdata.getDocument<Review>({
      dataEntity: 'reviews',
      id: args.id,
      fields: ['id', 'productId', 'author', 'rating', 'title', 'text', 'createdAt', 'approved'],
    })
  },
}

export const mutations = {
  createReview: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: { input: ReviewInput },
    ctx: Context
  ) => {
    const { input } = args

    const documentResponse = await ctx.clients.masterdata.createDocument({
      dataEntity: 'reviews',
      fields: {
        ...input,
        author: ctx.vtex.storeUserEmail ?? 'anonymous',
        approved: false,
        createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      },
      schema: 'review-schema-v1',
    })

    return ctx.clients.masterdata.getDocument<Review>({
      dataEntity: 'reviews',
      id: documentResponse.DocumentId,
      fields: ['id', 'productId', 'author', 'rating', 'title', 'text', 'createdAt', 'approved'],
    })
  },

  deleteReview: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: { id: string },
    ctx: Context
  ) => {
    await ctx.clients.masterdata.deleteDocument({
      dataEntity: 'reviews',
      id: args.id,
    })

    return true
  },
}
```

Wire resolvers into the Service:

```typescript
// node/index.ts
import type { ParamsContext, RecorderState } from '@vtex/api'
import { Service } from '@vtex/api'

import { Clients } from './clients'
import { queries, mutations } from './resolvers/reviews'

export default new Service<Clients, RecorderState, ParamsContext>({
  clients: {
    implementation: Clients,
    options: {
      default: {
        retries: 2,
        timeout: 5000,
      },
    },
  },
  graphql: {
    resolvers: {
      Query: queries,
      Mutation: mutations,
    },
  },
})
```

Testing the GraphQL API after linking:

```graphql
query GetReviews {
  reviews(productId: "12345", limit: 5) {

## Common failure modes

- **Defining resolvers without matching schema fields**: The GraphQL runtime only exposes fields defined in the schema. Resolvers without matching fields are silently ignored. Conversely, schema fields without resolvers return `null`. Always define the schema first, then implement matching resolvers with identical names.
- **Querying external APIs directly in resolvers**: Using `fetch()` or `axios` bypasses the `@vtex/api` client system, losing caching, retries, metrics, and authentication. Always use `ctx.clients` in resolvers.
- **Missing @auth on mutation endpoints**: Without `@auth`, any anonymous user can call the mutation — a critical security vulnerability. Always add `@auth` to mutations and queries returning sensitive data.
- **Missing @cacheControl on public queries**: Every request hits the resolver without caching, causing unnecessary load and slow responses. Add appropriate cache directives to all public Query fields.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is the `graphql` builder declared in `manifest.json`?
- [ ] Do all public Query fields have `@cacheControl` with appropriate scope and maxAge?
- [ ] Do all Mutations and sensitive Queries have `@auth`?
- [ ] Do resolver function keys exactly match schema field names?
- [ ] Are resolvers using `ctx.clients` for data access (no raw HTTP calls)?
- [ ] Are directive declarations present in `directives.graphql`?
- [ ] Is the resolver wired into the Service entry point under `graphql.resolvers`?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when working with masterdata v2 entities, schemas, or masterdataclient in vtex io apps. covers data entities, json schema definitions, crud operations, the masterdata builder, triggers, search and scroll operations, and schema lifecycle management. use for storing, querying, and managing custom data in vtex io apps while avoiding the 60-schema limit through proper schema versioning.

# MasterData v2 Integration

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when your VTEX IO app needs to store custom data (reviews, wishlists, form submissions, configuration records), query or filter that data, or set up automated workflows triggered by data changes.

- Defining data entities and JSON Schemas using the `masterdata` builder
- Performing CRUD operations through MasterDataClient (`ctx.clients.masterdata`)
- Configuring search, scroll, and indexing for efficient data retrieval
- Setting up Master Data triggers for automated workflows
- Managing schema lifecycle to avoid the 60-schema limit

Do not use this skill for:
- General backend service patterns (use `vtex-io-service-apps` instead)
- GraphQL schema definitions (use `vtex-io-graphql-api` instead)
- Manifest and builder configuration (use `vtex-io-app-structure` instead)

## Decision rules

- A **data entity** is a named collection of documents (analogous to a database table). A **JSON Schema** defines structure, validation, and indexing.
- When using the `masterdata` builder, entities are defined by folder structure: `masterdata/{entityName}/schema.json`. The builder creates entities named `{vendor}_{appName}_{entityName}`.
- Use `ctx.clients.masterdata` or `masterDataFor` from `@vtex/clients` for all CRUD operations — never direct REST calls.
- All fields used in `where` clauses MUST be declared in the schema's `v-indexed` array for efficient querying.
- Use `searchDocuments` for bounded result sets (known small size, max page size 100). Use `scrollDocuments` for large/unbounded result sets.
- The `masterdata` builder creates a new schema per app version. Clean up unused schemas to avoid the 60-schema-per-entity hard limit.

MasterDataClient methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `getDocument` | Retrieve a single document by ID |
| `createDocument` | Create a new document, returns generated ID |
| `createOrUpdateEntireDocument` | Upsert a complete document |
| `createOrUpdatePartialDocument` | Upsert partial fields (patch) |
| `updateEntireDocument` | Replace all fields of an existing document |
| `updatePartialDocument` | Update specific fields only |
| `deleteDocument` | Delete a document by ID |
| `searchDocuments` | Search with filters, pagination, and field selection |
| `searchDocumentsWithPaginationInfo` | Search with total count metadata |
| `scrollDocuments` | Iterate over large result sets |

Search `where` clause syntax:

```text
where: "productId=12345 AND approved=true"
where: "rating>3"
where: "createdAt between 2025-01-01 AND 2025-12-31"
```

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Use MasterDataClient — Never Direct REST Calls

All Master Data operations in VTEX IO apps MUST go through the MasterDataClient (`ctx.clients.masterdata`) or the `masterDataFor` factory from `@vtex/clients`. You MUST NOT make direct REST calls to `/api/dataentities/` endpoints.

**Why this matters**

The MasterDataClient handles authentication token injection, request routing, retry logic, caching, and proper error handling. Direct REST calls bypass all of these, requiring manual auth headers, pagination, and retry logic. When the VTEX auth token format changes, direct calls break while the client handles it transparently.

**Detection**

If you see direct HTTP calls to URLs matching `/api/dataentities/`, `api.vtex.com/api/dataentities`, or raw fetch/axios calls targeting Master Data endpoints, warn the developer to use `ctx.clients.masterdata` instead.

**Correct**

```typescript
// Using MasterDataClient through ctx.clients
export async function getReview(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const { id } = ctx.query

  const review = await ctx.clients.masterdata.getDocument<Review>({
    dataEntity: 'reviews',
    id: id as string,
    fields: ['id', 'productId', 'author', 'rating', 'title', 'text', 'approved'],
  })

  ctx.status = 200
  ctx.body = review
  await next()
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
// Direct REST call to Master Data — bypasses client infrastructure
import axios from 'axios'

export async function getReview(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const { id } = ctx.query

  // No caching, no retry, no proper auth, no metrics
  const response = await axios.get(
    `https://api.vtex.com/api/dataentities/reviews/documents/${id}`,
    {
      headers: {
        'X-VTEX-API-AppKey': process.env.VTEX_APP_KEY,
        'X-VTEX-API-AppToken': process.env.VTEX_APP_TOKEN,
      },
    }
  )

  ctx.status = 200
  ctx.body = response.data
  await next()
}
```

---

### Constraint: Define JSON Schemas for All Data Entities

Every data entity your app uses MUST have a corresponding JSON Schema, either via the `masterdata` builder (recommended) or created via the Master Data API before the app is deployed.

**Why this matters**

Without a schema, Master Data stores documents as unstructured JSON. This means no field validation, no indexing (making search extremely slow on large datasets), no type safety, and no trigger support. Queries on unindexed fields perform full scans, which can time out or hit rate limits.

**Detection**

If the app creates or searches documents in a data entity but no JSON Schema exists for that entity (either in the `masterdata/` builder directory or via API), warn the developer to define a schema.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
  "title": "review-schema-v1",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "productId": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "author": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "rating": {
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 1,
      "maximum": 5
    },
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 200
    },
    "text": {
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 5000
    },
    "approved": {
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    "createdAt": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time"
    }
  },
  "required": ["productId", "rating", "title", "text"],
  "v-default-fields": ["productId", "author", "rating", "title", "approved", "createdAt"],
  "v-indexed": ["productId", "author", "approved", "rating", "createdAt"]
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
// Saving documents without any schema — no validation, no indexing
await ctx.clients.masterdata.createDocument({
  dataEntity: 'reviews',
  fields: {
    productId: '12345',
    rating: 'five', // String instead of number — no validation!
    title: 123,     // Number instead of string — no validation!
  },
})

// Searching on unindexed fields — full table scan, will time out on large datasets
await ctx.clients.masterdata.searchDocuments({
  dataEntity: 'reviews',
  where: 'productId=12345',  // productId is not indexed — very slow
  fields: ['id', 'rating'],
  pagination: { page: 1, pageSize: 10 },
})
```

---

### Constraint: Manage Schema Versions to Avoid the 60-Schema Limit

Master Data v2 data entities have a limit of 60 schemas per entity. When using the `masterdata` builder, each app version linked or installed creates a new schema. You MUST delete unused schemas regularly.

**Why this matters**

Once the 60-schema limit is reached, the `masterdata` builder cannot create new schemas, and linking or installing new app versions will fail. This is a hard platform limit that cannot be increased.

**Detection**

If the app has been through many link/install cycles, warn the developer to check and clean up old schemas using the Delete Schema API.

**Correct**

```bash
# Periodically clean up unused schemas
# List schemas for the entity
curl -X GET "https://{account}.vtexcommercestable.com.br/api/dataentities/reviews/schemas" \
  -H "X-VTEX-API-AppKey: {appKey}" \
  -H "X-VTEX-API-AppToken: {appToken}"

# Delete old schemas that are no longer in use
curl -X DELETE "https://{account}.vtexcommercestable.com.br/api/dataentities/reviews/schemas/old-schema-name" \
  -H "X-VTEX-API-AppKey: {appKey}" \
  -H "X-VTEX-API-AppToken: {appToken}"
```

**Wrong**

```text
Never cleaning up schemas during development.
After 60 link cycles, the builder fails:
"Error: Maximum number of schemas reached for entity 'reviews'"
The app cannot be linked or installed until old schemas are deleted.
```

## Preferred pattern

Add the masterdata builder and policies:

```json
{
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x",
    "graphql": "1.x",
    "masterdata": "1.x"
  },
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "outbound-access",
      "attrs": {
        "host": "api.vtex.com",
        "path": "/api/*"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "ADMIN_DS"
    }
  ]
}
```

Define data entity schemas:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/schema#",
  "title": "review-schema-v1",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "productId": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "author": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "email": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "email"
    },
    "rating": {
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 1,
      "maximum": 5
    },
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 200
    },
    "text": {
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 5000
    },
    "approved": {
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    "createdAt": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time"
    }
  },
  "required": ["productId", "rating", "title", "text"],
  "v-default-fields": ["productId", "author", "rating", "title", "approved", "createdAt"],
  "v-indexed": ["productId", "author", "approved", "rating", "createdAt"],
  "v-cache": false
}
```

Set up the client with `masterDataFor`:

```typescript
// node/clients/index.ts
import { IOClients } from '@vtex/api'
import { masterDataFor } from '@vtex/clients'

interface Review {
  id: string
  productId: string
  author: string
  email: string
  rating: number
  title: string
  text: string
  approved: boolean
  createdAt: string
}

export class Clients extends IOClients {
  public get reviews() {
    return this.getOrSet('reviews', masterDataFor<Review>('reviews'))
  }
}
```

Implement CRUD operations:

```typescript
// node/resolvers/reviews.ts
import type { ServiceContext } from '@vtex/api'
import type { Clients } from '../clients'

type Context = ServiceContext<Clients>

export const queries = {
  reviews: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: { productId: string; page?: number; pageSize?: number },
    ctx: Context
  ) => {
    const { productId, page = 1, pageSize = 10 } = args

    const results = await ctx.clients.reviews.search(
      { page, pageSize },
      ['id', 'productId', 'author', 'rating', 'title', 'text', 'createdAt', 'approved'],
      '',  // sort
      `productId=${productId} AND approved=true`
    )

    return results
  },
}

export const mutations = {
  createReview: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: { input: { productId: string; rating: number; title: string; text: string } },
    ctx: Context
  ) => {
    const { input } = args
    const email = ctx.vtex.storeUserEmail ?? 'anonymous@store.com'

    const response = await ctx.clients.reviews.save({
      ...input,
      author: email.split('@')[0],
      email,
      approved: false,
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    })

    return ctx.clients.reviews.get(response.DocumentId, [
      'id', 'productId', 'author', 'rating', 'title', 'text', 'createdAt', 'approved',
    ])
  },

  deleteReview: async (
    _root: unknown,
    args: { id: string },
    ctx: Context
  ) => {
    await ctx.clients.reviews.delete(args.id)
    return true
  },
}
```

Configure triggers (optional):

```json
{
  "name": "notify-moderator-on-new-review",
  "active": true,
  "condition": "approved=false",
  "action": {
    "type": "email",
    "provider": "default",
    "subject": "New review pending moderation",
    "to": ["moderator@mystore.com"],
    "body": "A new review has been submitted for product {{productId}} by {{author}}."
  },
  "retry": {
    "times": 3,
    "delay": { "addMinutes": 5 }
  }
}
```

Wire into Service:

```typescript
// node/index.ts
import type { ParamsContext, RecorderState } from '@vtex/api'
import { Service } from '@vtex/api'

import { Clients } from './clients'
import { queries, mutations } from './resolvers/reviews'

export default new Service<Clients, RecorderState, ParamsContext>({
  clients: {
    implementation: Clients,
    options: {
      default: {
        retries: 2,
        timeout: 5000,
      },
    },
  },
  graphql: {
    resolvers: {
      Query: queries,
      Mutation: mutations,
    },
  },
})
```

## Common failure modes

- **Direct REST calls to /api/dataentities/**: Using `axios` or `fetch` to call Master Data endpoints bypasses the client infrastructure — no auth, no caching, no retries. Use `ctx.clients.masterdata` or `masterDataFor` instead.
- **Searching without indexed fields**: Queries on non-indexed fields trigger full document scans. For large datasets, this causes timeouts and rate limit errors. Ensure all `where` clause fields are in the schema's `v-indexed` array.
- **Not paginating search results**: Master Data v2 has a maximum page size of 100 documents. Requesting more silently returns only up to the limit. Use proper pagination or `scrollDocuments` for large result sets.
- **Ignoring the 60-schema limit**: Each app version linked/installed creates a new schema. After 60 link cycles, the builder fails. Periodically clean up unused schemas via the Delete Schema API.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Is the `masterdata` builder declared in `manifest.json`?
- [ ] Do all data entities have JSON Schemas with proper field definitions?
- [ ] Are all `where` clause fields declared in `v-indexed`?
- [ ] Are CRUD operations using `ctx.clients.masterdata` or `masterDataFor` (no direct REST calls)?
- [ ] Is pagination properly handled (max 100 per page, scroll for large sets)?
- [ ] Is there a plan for schema cleanup to avoid the 60-schema limit?
- [ ] Are required policies (`outbound-access`, `ADMIN_DS`) declared in the manifest?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when building react components under react/ or configuring store blocks in store/ for vtex io apps. covers interfaces.json, contentschemas.json for site editor, vtex styleguide for admin apps, and css-handles for storefront styling. use for creating custom storefront components, admin panels, pixel apps, or any frontend development within the vtex io react builder ecosystem.

# Frontend React Components & Hooks

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when building VTEX IO frontend apps using the `react` builder — creating React components that integrate with Store Framework as theme blocks, configuring `interfaces.json`, setting up `contentSchemas.json` for Site Editor, and applying styling patterns.

- Creating custom storefront components (product displays, forms, banners)
- Building admin panel interfaces with VTEX Styleguide
- Registering components as Store Framework blocks
- Exposing component props in Site Editor via `contentSchemas.json`
- Applying `css-handles` for safe storefront styling

Do not use this skill for:
- Backend service implementation (use `vtex-io-service-apps` instead)
- GraphQL schema and resolver development (use `vtex-io-graphql-api` instead)
- Manifest and builder configuration (use `vtex-io-app-structure` instead)

## Decision rules

- Every visible storefront element is a **block**. Blocks are declared in theme JSON and map to React components via **interfaces**.
- `interfaces.json` (in `/store`) maps block names to React component files: `"component"` is the file name in `/react` (without extension), `"allowed"` lists child blocks, `"composition"` controls how children work (`"children"` or `"blocks"`).
- Each exported component MUST have a root-level file in `/react` that re-exports it. The builder resolves `"component": "ProductReviews"` to `react/ProductReviews.tsx`.
- For **storefront** components, use `vtex.css-handles` for styling (not inline styles, not global CSS).
- For **admin** components, use `vtex.styleguide` — the official VTEX Admin component library. No third-party UI libraries.
- Use `contentSchemas.json` in `/store` to make component props editable in Site Editor (JSON Schema format).
- Use `react-intl` and the `messages` builder for i18n — never hardcode user-facing strings.
- Fetch data via GraphQL queries (`useQuery` from `react-apollo`), never via direct API calls from the browser.

Architecture:

```text
Store Theme (JSON blocks)
  └── declares "product-reviews" block with props
        │
        ▼
interfaces.json → maps "product-reviews" to "ProductReviews" component
        │
        ▼
react/ProductReviews.tsx → React component renders
        │
        ├── useCssHandles() → CSS classes for styling
        ├── useQuery() → GraphQL data fetching
        └── useProduct() / useOrderForm() → Store Framework context hooks
```

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Declare Interfaces for All Storefront Blocks

Every React component that should be usable as a Store Framework block MUST have a corresponding entry in `store/interfaces.json`. Without the interface declaration, the block cannot be referenced in theme JSON files.

**Why this matters**

The store builder resolves block names to React components through `interfaces.json`. If a component has no interface, it is invisible to Store Framework and will not render on the storefront.

**Detection**

If a React component in `/react` is intended for storefront use but has no matching entry in `store/interfaces.json`, warn the developer. The component will compile but never render.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "product-reviews": {
    "component": "ProductReviews",
    "composition": "children",
    "allowed": ["product-review-item"]
  },
  "product-review-item": {
    "component": "ReviewItem"
  }
}
```

```tsx
// react/ProductReviews.tsx
import ProductReviews from './components/ProductReviews'

export default ProductReviews
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
// react/ProductReviews.tsx exists but NO store/interfaces.json entry
// The component compiles fine but cannot be used in any theme.
// Adding <product-reviews /> in a theme JSON will produce:
// "Block 'product-reviews' not found"
import ProductReviews from './components/ProductReviews'

export default ProductReviews
```

---

### Constraint: Use VTEX Styleguide for Admin UIs

Admin panel components (apps using the `admin` builder) MUST use VTEX Styleguide (`vtex.styleguide`) for UI elements. You MUST NOT use third-party UI libraries like Material UI, Chakra UI, or Ant Design in admin apps.

**Why this matters**

VTEX Admin has a consistent design language enforced by Styleguide. Third-party UI libraries produce inconsistent visuals, may conflict with the Admin's global CSS, and add unnecessary bundle size. Apps submitted to the VTEX App Store with non-Styleguide admin UIs will fail review.

**Detection**

If you see imports from `@material-ui`, `@chakra-ui/react`, `@chakra-ui`, `antd`, or `@ant-design` in an admin app, warn the developer to use `vtex.styleguide` instead.

**Correct**

```tsx
// react/admin/ReviewModeration.tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import {
  Layout,
  PageHeader,
  Table,
  Button,
  Tag,
  Modal,
  Input,
} from 'vtex.styleguide'

interface Review {
  id: string
  author: string
  rating: number
  text: string
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected'
}

function ReviewModeration() {
  const [reviews, setReviews] = useState<Review[]>([])
  const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false)

  const tableSchema = {
    properties: {
      author: { title: 'Author', width: 200 },
      rating: { title: 'Rating', width: 100 },
      text: { title: 'Review Text' },
      status: {
        title: 'Status',
        width: 150,
        cellRenderer: ({ cellData }: { cellData: string }) => (
          <Tag type={cellData === 'approved' ? 'success' : 'error'}>
            {cellData}
          </Tag>
        ),
      },
    },
  }

  return (
    <Layout fullWidth pageHeader={<PageHeader title="Review Moderation" />}>
      <Table
        items={reviews}
        schema={tableSchema}
        density="medium"
      />
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default ReviewModeration
```

**Wrong**

```tsx
// react/admin/ReviewModeration.tsx

### Constraint: Export Components from react/ Root Level

Every Store Framework block component MUST have a root-level export file in the `/react` directory that matches the `component` value in `interfaces.json`. The actual implementation can live in subdirectories, but the root file must exist.

**Why this matters**

The react builder resolves components by looking for files at the root of `/react`. If `interfaces.json` declares `"component": "ProductReviews"`, the builder looks for `react/ProductReviews.tsx`. Without this root export file, the component will not be found and the block will fail to render.

**Detection**

If `interfaces.json` references a component name that does not have a matching file at the root of `/react`, STOP and create the export file.

**Correct**

```tsx
// react/ProductReviews.tsx — root-level export file
import ProductReviews from './components/ProductReviews/index'

export default ProductReviews
```

```tsx
// react/components/ProductReviews/index.tsx — actual implementation
import React from 'react'
import { useCssHandles } from 'vtex.css-handles'

const CSS_HANDLES = ['container', 'title', 'list'] as const

interface Props {
  title: string
  maxReviews: number
}

function ProductReviews({ title, maxReviews }: Props) {
  const handles = useCssHandles(CSS_HANDLES)
  return (
    <div className={handles.container}>
      <h2 className={handles.title}>{title}</h2>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  )
}

export default ProductReviews
```

**Wrong**

```text
react/components/ProductReviews/index.tsx exists but
react/ProductReviews.tsx does NOT exist.
The builder cannot find the component.
Error: "Could not find component ProductReviews"
```

## Preferred pattern

Create the React component inside a subdirectory:

```tsx
// react/components/ProductReviews/index.tsx
import React, { useMemo } from 'react'
import { useQuery } from 'react-apollo'
import { useProduct } from 'vtex.product-context'
import { useCssHandles } from 'vtex.css-handles'

import GET_REVIEWS from '../../graphql/getReviews.graphql'
import ReviewItem from './ReviewItem'

const CSS_HANDLES = [
  'reviewsContainer',
  'reviewsTitle',
  'reviewsList',
  'averageRating',
  'emptyState',
] as const

interface Props {
  title?: string
  showAverage?: boolean
  maxReviews?: number
}

function ProductReviews({
  title = 'Customer Reviews',
  showAverage = true,
  maxReviews = 10,
}: Props) {
  const handles = useCssHandles(CSS_HANDLES)
  const productContext = useProduct()
  const productId = productContext?.product?.productId

  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_REVIEWS, {
    variables: { productId, limit: maxReviews },
    skip: !productId,
  })

  const averageRating = useMemo(() => {
    if (!data?.reviews?.length) return 0

    const sum = data.reviews.reduce(
      (acc: number, review: { rating: number }) => acc + review.rating,
      0
    )

    return (sum / data.reviews.length).toFixed(1)
  }, [data])

  if (loading) return <div className={handles.reviewsContainer}>Loading...</div>
  if (error) return null

  return (
    <div className={handles.reviewsContainer}>
      <h2 className={handles.reviewsTitle}>{title}</h2>

      {showAverage && data?.reviews?.length > 0 && (
        <div className={handles.averageRating}>
          Average: {averageRating} / 5
        </div>
      )}

      {data?.reviews?.length === 0 ? (
        <p className={handles.emptyState}>No reviews yet.</p>
      ) : (
        <ul className={handles.reviewsList}>
          {data.reviews.map((review: { id: string; author: string; rating: number; text: string }) => (
            <ReviewItem key={review.id} review={review} />
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default ProductReviews
```

Root export file:

```tsx
// react/ProductReviews.tsx
import ProductReviews from './components/ProductReviews'

export default ProductReviews
```

Block interface:

```json
{
  "product-reviews": {
    "component": "ProductReviews",
    "composition": "children",
    "allowed": ["product-review-form"],
    "render": "client"
  }
}
```

Site Editor schema:

```json
{
  "definitions": {
    "ProductReviews": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "title": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Section Title",
          "description": "Title displayed above the reviews list",
          "default": "Customer Reviews"
        },
        "showAverage": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "title": "Show average rating",
          "default": true
        },
        "maxReviews": {
          "type": "number",
          "title": "Maximum reviews",
          "default": 10,
          "enum": [5, 10, 20, 50]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Using the component in a Store Framework theme:

```json
{
  "store.product": {
    "children": [
      "product-images",
      "product-name",
      "product-price",
      "buy-button",
      "product-reviews"
    ]
  },
  "product-reviews": {
    "props": {
      "title": "What Our Customers Say",
      "showAverage": true,
      "maxReviews": 20
    }
  }
}
```

## Common failure modes

- **Importing third-party UI libraries for admin apps**: Using `@material-ui/core`, `@chakra-ui/react`, or `antd` conflicts with VTEX Admin's global CSS, produces inconsistent visuals, and will fail App Store review. Use `vtex.styleguide` instead.
- **Directly calling APIs from React components**: Using `fetch()` or `axios` exposes authentication tokens to the client and bypasses CORS restrictions. Use GraphQL queries that resolve server-side via `useQuery` from `react-apollo`.
- **Hardcoded strings without i18n**: Components with hardcoded strings only work in one language. Use the `messages` builder and `react-intl` for internationalization.
- **Missing root-level export file**: If `interfaces.json` references `"component": "ProductReviews"` but `react/ProductReviews.tsx` doesn't exist, the block silently fails to render.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Does every storefront block have a matching entry in `store/interfaces.json`?
- [ ] Does every `interfaces.json` component have a root-level export file in `/react`?
- [ ] Are admin apps using `vtex.styleguide` (no third-party UI libraries)?
- [ ] Are storefront components using `css-handles` for styling?
- [ ] Is data fetched via GraphQL (`useQuery`), not direct API calls?
- [ ] Are user-facing strings using `react-intl` and the `messages` builder?
- [ ] Is `contentSchemas.json` defined for Site Editor-editable props?

This skill provides guidance for AI agents working with VTEX Custom VTEX IO Apps. Apply these constraints and patterns when assisting developers with apply when building backend service apps under node/ in a vtex io project or configuring service.json routes. covers the service class, middleware functions, ctx.clients pattern, janusclient, externalclient, masterdataclient, and ioclients registration. use for implementing backend apis, event handlers, or integrations that must use @vtex/api clients instead of raw http libraries.

# Backend Service Apps & API Clients

## When this skill applies

Use this skill when developing a VTEX IO app that needs backend logic — REST API routes, GraphQL resolvers, event handlers, scheduled tasks, or integrations with VTEX Commerce APIs and external services.

- Building the Service entry point (`node/index.ts`) with typed context, clients, and state
- Creating and registering custom clients extending JanusClient or ExternalClient
- Using `ctx.clients` to access clients with built-in caching, retry, and metrics
- Configuring routes and middleware chains in service.json

Do not use this skill for:
- Manifest and builder configuration (use `vtex-io-app-structure` instead)
- GraphQL schema definitions (use `vtex-io-graphql-api` instead)
- React component development (use `vtex-io-react-apps` instead)

## Decision rules

- The Service class (`node/index.ts`) is the entry point for every VTEX IO backend app. It receives clients, routes (with middleware chains), GraphQL resolvers, and event handlers.
- Every middleware, resolver, and event handler receives `ctx` with: `ctx.clients` (registered clients), `ctx.state` (mutable per-request state), `ctx.vtex` (auth tokens, account info), `ctx.body` (request/response body).
- Use `JanusClient` for VTEX internal APIs (base URL: `https://{account}.vtexcommercestable.com.br`).
- Use `ExternalClient` for non-VTEX APIs (any URL you specify).
- Use `AppClient` for routes exposed by other VTEX IO apps.
- Use `MasterDataClient` for Master Data v2 CRUD operations.
- Register custom clients by extending `IOClients` — each client is lazily instantiated on first access via `this.getOrSet()`.
- Keep clients as thin data-access wrappers. Put business logic in middlewares or service functions.

Client hierarchy:

| Class | Use Case | Base URL |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `JanusClient` | Access VTEX internal APIs (Janus gateway) | `https://{account}.vtexcommercestable.com.br` |
| `ExternalClient` | Access external (non-VTEX) APIs | Any URL you specify |
| `AppClient` | Access routes exposed by other VTEX IO apps | `https://{workspace}--{account}.myvtex.com` |
| `InfraClient` | Access VTEX IO infrastructure services | Internal |
| `MasterDataClient` | Access Master Data v2 CRUD operations | VTEX API |

Architecture:

```text
Request → VTEX IO Runtime → Service
  ├── routes → middleware chain → ctx.clients.{name}.method()
  ├── graphql → resolvers → ctx.clients.{name}.method()
  └── events → handlers → ctx.clients.{name}.method()
                               │
                               ▼
                         Client (JanusClient / ExternalClient)
                               │
                               ▼
                    External Service / VTEX API
```

## Hard constraints

### Constraint: Use @vtex/api Clients — Never Raw HTTP Libraries

All HTTP communication from a VTEX IO service app MUST go through `@vtex/api` clients (JanusClient, ExternalClient, AppClient, or native clients from `@vtex/clients`). You MUST NOT use `axios`, `fetch`, `got`, `node-fetch`, or any other raw HTTP library.

**Why this matters**

VTEX IO clients provide automatic authentication header injection, built-in caching (disk and memory), retry with exponential backoff, timeout management, native metrics and billing tracking, and proper error handling. Raw HTTP libraries bypass all of these. Additionally, outbound traffic from VTEX IO is firewalled — only `@vtex/api` clients properly route through the infrastructure.

**Detection**

If you see `import axios from 'axios'`, `import fetch from 'node-fetch'`, `import got from 'got'`, `require('node-fetch')`, or any direct `fetch()` call in a VTEX IO service app, STOP. Replace with a proper client extending JanusClient or ExternalClient.

**Correct**

```typescript
import type { InstanceOptions, IOContext } from '@vtex/api'
import { ExternalClient } from '@vtex/api'

export class WeatherClient extends ExternalClient {
  constructor(context: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super('https://api.weather.com', context, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        'X-Api-Key': 'my-key',
        ...options?.headers,
      },
    })
  }

  public async getForecast(city: string): Promise<Forecast> {
    return this.http.get(`/v1/forecast/${city}`, {
      metric: 'weather-forecast',
    })
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
import axios from 'axios'

// This bypasses VTEX IO infrastructure entirely.
// No caching, no retries, no metrics, no auth token injection.
// Outbound requests may be blocked by the firewall.
export async function getForecast(city: string): Promise<Forecast> {
  const response = await axios.get(`https://api.weather.com/v1/forecast/${city}`, {
    headers: { 'X-Api-Key': 'my-key' },
  })
  return response.data
}
```

---

### Constraint: Access Clients via ctx.clients — Never Instantiate Directly

Clients MUST always be accessed through `ctx.clients.{clientName}` in middlewares, resolvers, and event handlers. You MUST NOT instantiate client classes directly with `new`.

**Why this matters**

The IOClients registry manages client lifecycle, ensuring proper initialization with the current request's IOContext (account, workspace, auth tokens). Direct instantiation creates clients without authentication context, without caching configuration, and without connection to the metrics pipeline.

**Detection**

If you see `new MyClient(...)` or `new ExternalClient(...)` inside a middleware or resolver, STOP. The client should be registered in the Clients class and accessed via `ctx.clients`.

**Correct**

```typescript
// node/clients/index.ts
import { IOClients } from '@vtex/api'
import { CatalogClient } from './catalogClient'

export class Clients extends IOClients {
  public get catalog() {
    return this.getOrSet('catalog', CatalogClient)
  }
}

// node/middlewares/getProduct.ts
export async function getProduct(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const { clients: { catalog } } = ctx
  const product = await catalog.getProductById(ctx.query.id)
  ctx.body = product
  ctx.status = 200
  await next()
}
```

**Wrong**

```typescript
// node/middlewares/getProduct.ts
import { CatalogClient } from '../clients/catalogClient'

export async function getProduct(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  // Direct instantiation — no auth context, no caching, no metrics
  const catalog = new CatalogClient(ctx.vtex, {})
  const product = await catalog.getProductById(ctx.query.id)
  ctx.body = product
  ctx.status = 200
  await next()
}
```

---

### Constraint: Avoid Monolithic Service Apps

A single service app SHOULD NOT define more than 10 HTTP routes. If you need more, consider splitting into focused microservice apps.

**Why this matters**

VTEX IO apps run in containers with limited memory (max 512MB). A monolithic app with many routes increases memory usage, cold start time, and blast radius of failures. The VTEX IO platform is designed for small, focused apps that compose together.

**Detection**

If `service.json` defines more than 10 routes, warn the developer to consider splitting the app into smaller services. This is a soft limit — there may be valid exceptions.

**Correct**

```json
{
  "memory": 256,
  "timeout": 30,
  "routes": {
    "get-reviews": { "path": "/_v/api/reviews", "public": false },
    "get-review": { "path": "/_v/api/reviews/:id", "public": false },
    "create-review": { "path": "/_v/api/reviews", "public": false },
    "moderate-review": { "path": "/_v/api/reviews/:id/moderate", "public": false }
  }
}
```

**Wrong**

```json
{
  "memory": 512,
  "timeout": 60,
  "routes": {
    "route1": { "path": "/_v/api/reviews" },
    "route2": { "path": "/_v/api/reviews/:id" },
    "route3": { "path": "/_v/api/products" },
    "route4": { "path": "/_v/api/products/:id" },
    "route5": { "path": "/_v/api/orders" },
    "route6": { "path": "/_v/api/orders/:id" },
    "route7": { "path": "/_v/api/users" },
    "route8": { "path": "/_v/api/users/:id" },
    "route9": { "path": "/_v/api/categories" },
    "route10": { "path": "/_v/api/categories/:id" },
    "route11": { "path": "/_v/api/brands" },
    "route12": { "path": "/_v/api/inventory" }
  }
}
```

12 routes covering reviews, products, orders, users, categories, brands, and inventory — this should be 3-4 separate apps.

## Preferred pattern

Define custom clients:

```typescript
// node/clients/catalogClient.ts
import type { InstanceOptions, IOContext } from '@vtex/api'
import { JanusClient } from '@vtex/api'

export class CatalogClient extends JanusClient {
  constructor(context: IOContext, options?: InstanceOptions) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        VtexIdclientAutCookie: context.authToken,
        ...options?.headers,
      },
    })
  }

  public async getProduct(productId: string): Promise<Product> {
    return this.http.get(`/api/catalog/pvt/product/${productId}`, {
      metric: 'catalog-get-product',
    })
  }

  public async listSkusByProduct(productId: string): Promise<Sku[]> {
    return this.http.get(`/api/catalog_system/pvt/sku/stockkeepingunitByProductId/${productId}`, {
      metric: 'catalog-list-skus',
    })
  }
}
```

Register clients in IOClients:

```typescript
// node/clients/index.ts
import { IOClients } from '@vtex/api'
import { CatalogClient } from './catalogClient'
import { ReviewStorageClient } from './reviewStorageClient'

export class Clients extends IOClients {
  public get catalog() {
    return this.getOrSet('catalog', CatalogClient)
  }

  public get reviewStorage() {
    return this.getOrSet('reviewStorage', ReviewStorageClient)
  }
}
```

Create middlewares using `ctx.clients` and `ctx.state`:

```typescript
// node/middlewares/getReviews.ts
import type { ServiceContext } from '@vtex/api'
import type { Clients } from '../clients'

type Context = ServiceContext<Clients>

export async function validateParams(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const { productId } = ctx.query

  if (!productId || typeof productId !== 'string') {
    ctx.status = 400
    ctx.body = { error: 'productId query parameter is required' }
    return
  }

  ctx.state.productId = productId
  await next()
}

export async function getReviews(ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) {
  const { productId } = ctx.state
  const reviews = await ctx.clients.reviewStorage.getByProduct(productId)

  ctx.status = 200
  ctx.body = reviews
  await next()
}
```

Wire everything in the Service entry point:

```typescript
// node/index.ts
import type { ParamsContext, RecorderState } from '@vtex/api'
import { Service, method } from '@vtex/api'

import { Clients } from './clients'
import { validateParams, getReviews } from './middlewares/getReviews'
import { createReview } from './middlewares/createReview'
import { resolvers } from './resolvers'

export default new Service<Clients, RecorderState, ParamsContext>({
  clients: {
    implementation: Clients,
    options: {
      default: {
        retries: 2,
        timeout: 5000,
      },
      catalog: {
        retries: 3,
        timeout: 10000,
      },
    },
  },
  routes: {
    reviews: method({
      GET: [validateParams, getReviews],
      POST: [createReview],
    }),
  },
  graphql: {
    resolvers: {
      Query: resolvers.queries,
      Mutation: resolvers.mutations,
    },
  },
})
```

## Common failure modes

- **Using axios/fetch/got/node-fetch for HTTP calls**: These libraries bypass the entire VTEX IO infrastructure — no automatic auth token injection, no caching, no retry logic, no metrics. Outbound requests may also be blocked by the firewall. Create a proper client extending `ExternalClient` or `JanusClient` instead.
- **Putting business logic in clients**: Clients become bloated and hard to test. Keep clients as thin wrappers around HTTP calls. Put business logic in middlewares or dedicated service functions.
- **Direct client instantiation**: Using `new MyClient(...)` inside a middleware creates clients without auth context, caching, or metrics. Always access via `ctx.clients`.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Are all HTTP calls going through `@vtex/api` clients (no axios, fetch, got)?
- [ ] Are all clients accessed via `ctx.clients`, never instantiated with `new`?
- [ ] Are custom clients registered in the IOClients class?
- [ ] Does the Service entry point correctly wire clients, routes, resolvers, and events?
- [ ] Is business logic in middlewares/resolvers, not in client classes?
- [ ] Does `service.json` have reasonable route count (≤10)?
- [ ] Are client options (retries, timeout) configured appropriately?
