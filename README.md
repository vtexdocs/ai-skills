## Quick Start

### GitHub CLI (Recommended — requires `gh` v2.90.0+)

If you have the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed, this is the fastest path. It auto-detects which agents you have configured, supports version pinning, and provides `gh skill update` to stay current.

```bash
# Browse and install skills interactively
gh skill install vtex/skills

# Install a specific skill
gh skill install vtex/skills payment-provider-protocol

# Target a specific agent explicitly
gh skill install vtex/skills payment-provider-protocol --agent claude-code

# Pin to a release for reproducibility
gh skill install vtex/skills payment-provider-protocol --pin v1.9.0

# Keep all installed skills up to date
gh skill update --all
```

Skills are installed to `.agents/skills/` at project scope by default — shared automatically across GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Windsurf, and [40+ other agents](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_skill_install). Use `--scope user` to install globally instead.

### npx (No GitHub CLI required)

Works on any machine with Node.js. Handles bulk installs and is CI-friendly:

```bash
npx skills add vtex/skills
```

Use `--list` to preview available skills before installing, `--all --yes` to install everything non-interactively, or `--agent <name>` to target a specific tool.

### Platform-specific installs (fallback)

<details>
<summary>Install directly via curl, manual copy, or file upload — no CLI needed</summary>

#### AGENTS.md (works with Cursor, Copilot, Codex, Windsurf, Amp, Devin, and more)

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/vtex/skills/releases/latest/download/agents-md.tar.gz | tar xz -C your-project/
```

This places a root `AGENTS.md` with links to per-track files in subdirectories. Most AI coding tools discover and follow these instructions automatically.

#### Cursor

```bash
mkdir -p your-project/.cursor/rules
curl -sL https://github.com/vtex/skills/releases/latest/download/cursor-rules.tar.gz | tar xz -C your-project/.cursor/rules/
```

Each `.mdc` file includes glob patterns that auto-attach the rule when you open matching files. Per-track composites (e.g., `faststore-all.mdc`) are also available.

#### GitHub Copilot

```bash
mkdir -p your-project/.github
curl -sL https://github.com/vtex/skills/releases/latest/download/copilot-instructions.tar.gz | tar xz -C your-project/.github/
```

Per-track files are available in `exports/copilot/` if you only need a subset.

#### Claude Projects

Upload files from [`exports/claude/`](exports/claude/) as project knowledge in your Claude Project settings. Use individual skill files for focused context, or per-track composites (e.g., `faststore.md`) for broader coverage.

#### OpenCode

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/vtex/skills/releases/latest/download/opencode-skills.tar.gz | tar xz -C ~/.config/opencode/skills/
```

Each skill becomes a directory with a `SKILL.md` file. OpenCode discovers them automatically and makes them available as loadable skills in your sessions.

#### Clone and copy locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vtex/skills.git
cd skills

# AGENTS.md
cp -r exports/agents-md/. /path/to/your-project/

# Cursor
mkdir -p /path/to/your-project/.cursor/rules
cp exports/cursor/*.mdc /path/to/your-project/.cursor/rules/

# Copilot
cp exports/copilot/copilot-instructions.md /path/to/your-project/.github/copilot-instructions.md

# OpenCode
cp -r exports/opencode/. ~/.config/opencode/skills/
```

## Why Use This?

- **AI assistants don't know VTEX-specific patterns.** The Overrides API, PPP endpoints, BFF requirements, and MasterData schema limits aren't in any LLM's training data at the depth you need. These skills fill that gap.
- **Real constraints, not generic advice.** PCI compliance via the Secure Proxy, idempotency requirements on payment endpoints, the 2.5s fulfillment simulation timeout, the 60-schema MasterData limit — these are the details that prevent costly mistakes in production.
- **One source, six platforms.** Skills are authored once in a canonical Markdown format and exported automatically. No manual sync, no drift between tools.
- **Built from official VTEX documentation.** Not generic LLM knowledge. Every constraint has a source, a detection pattern, and paired correct/wrong code examples.

## Open Plugins / Cursor Directory

This repository is an [Open Plugin](https://open-plugins.com) — a portable, platform-agnostic skill pack that any AI coding tool can discover and install.

```
rules/*.mdc              # Cursor rules (auto-discovered)
skills/*/SKILL.md        # Agent skills (auto-discovered)
.cursor-plugin/plugin.json   # Cursor plugin manifest
.plugin/plugin.json          # Vendor-neutral plugin manifest
```

Compatible tools (Cursor, Claude Code, and others implementing the Open Plugins spec) can install this repo directly as a plugin. The `rules/` and `skills/` directories at the repo root follow the standard layout, and the manifests provide metadata for discovery.

```

### Export Commands

Generate platform exports from the source skill files:

```bash
# Export to all platforms
bun run export

# Export to a specific platform
bun run export:cursor
bun run export:copilot
bun run export:claude
bun run export:agents-md
bun run export:opencode
bun run export:kiro
```

Exports are written to `exports/{platform}/` and overwrite existing files. Run export after any skill changes before committing.

### Validation

Check all skill files for quality and correctness before exporting:

```bash
bun run validate
```

The validator runs 13 checks on every skill file, split into **hard** (must pass — block CI) and **soft** (produce warnings only):

**Hard checks** (9):
- **yaml-validity** — frontmatter parses without errors, has required fields (name, description, track, tags)
- **description-quality** — description is at least 20 words
- **code-block-annotations** — all opening code fences have a language annotation
- **no-placeholders** — no `TBD`, `TODO`, or `FIXME` text in prose
- **size-bounds** — skill files are within acceptable size limits
- **track-consistency** — the `track` frontmatter field matches the directory
- **globs-format** — if present, the `globs` field is a valid array of glob pattern strings
- **filename-casing** — the file is named `skill.md` (lowercase)
- **companion-links** — all relative links in the skill file resolve to existing files

**Soft checks** (4) — produce warnings but do not block CI:
- **required-sections** — recommended H2 sections present (decision-oriented template)
- **detection-patterns** — constraints include a Detection field
- **paired-examples** — constraints have both a Correct and Wrong example
- **url-format** — VTEX doc links use the correct domain format
