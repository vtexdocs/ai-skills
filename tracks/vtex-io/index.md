# Custom VTEX IO Apps

Guide to building custom VTEX IO applications, covering builders, policies, `@vtex/api` clients, service patterns, and app development best practices. This track covers everything needed to build production-ready VTEX IO apps that extend the VTEX platform with custom functionality.

## Overview

VTEX IO is a serverless platform for building custom applications that extend VTEX Commerce. This track teaches developers how to scaffold VTEX IO apps, configure builders (`node`, `react`, `graphql`, `admin`, `pixel`, `messages`, `store`), declare policies for API access, implement backend services with the `Service` class and client system, build frontend React components and Store Framework blocks, expose APIs, and manage data and configuration safely.

The VTEX IO track is being reorganized into smaller, more decision-oriented skills. The source files now mix stable skills and newer draft splits while the track converges on the grouped model below.

## Recommended Learning Order

1. **Start with App Architecture** — Understand `manifest.json`, builders, and policies first. This is the foundation for all VTEX IO apps.
2. **Learn Backend Services** — Understand the Service class, clients, and middleware pattern for building backend logic.
3. **Service paths & application performance** — After you have routes, align **path patterns** with **cookies** and **edge caching**; add **LRU/VBase**, **parallel** fetches, **resolver deduplication**, and **efficient** AppSettings/context where needed. Understand what must never be cached (transactional data) and when VBase writes must be awaited.
4. **Add Frontend Components** — Learn how to build React components and register them as Store Framework blocks.
5. **Expose GraphQL APIs** — Learn how to define schemas and resolvers for data access.
6. **Session transforms** — When your app needs to derive session state (B2B pricing, regionalization, custom context), learn namespace ownership, input propagation, and caching inside transforms.
7. **Store Custom Data** — Use Master Data v2 only after **scrutinizing** the storage choice: confirm MD fits the workload, audit entity governance, or use another VTEX surface or external DB.

## Planned Learning Flow

1. **Foundations** — Start with app contract, service runtime, and client integration.
2. **API exposure** — Choose between `graphql`, `http-routes`, and `events-and-workers` based on the integration shape.
3. **Frontend** — Split storefront React, admin React, and render/runtime concerns.
4. **Data and config** — Separate app settings, Master Data strategy, and general data access patterns.
5. **Security and operations** — Finish with auth tokens, policy boundaries, and operational visibility.

## Choosing The API Exposure Skill

- Use `vtex-io-graphql-api` when frontend or app consumers need structured querying and typed aggregation.
- Use `vtex-io-http-routes` for explicit integration endpoints, callbacks, or webhook-style contracts.
- Use `vtex-io-events-and-workers` for asynchronous processing, retries, and work that should not block a request-response cycle.

## Key Constraints Summary

- **`manifest.json` is mandatory** — Every VTEX IO app requires a valid manifest. Without it, the app cannot be linked, published, or deployed.
- **Builders must be declared in `manifest.json`** — Only declared builders are processed. Undeclared builders are ignored.
- **Policies are required for external access** — Declare policies for outbound-access (external URLs) and VTEX resources. Missing policies cause 403 Forbidden errors.
- **Always use `ctx.clients` for API access** — Never instantiate clients directly. The `ctx.clients` pattern provides caching, retry, and metrics.
- **Match route prefix to data scope** — Public vs `/_v/segment` vs `/_v/private` controls cookies and edge caching ([Service path patterns](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/service-path-patterns)); do not CDN-cache private or auth-scoped JSON.
- **Layer application performance patterns deliberately** — LRU for hot keys, VBase for shared stale-while-revalidate, **tenant-scoped** in-memory keys (`account` + `workspace`) on shared pods. Every outbound call needs an **explicit timeout**; degrade gracefully when upstreams are slow. Never cache transactional data (order forms, cart simulations, payment responses). Await VBase writes in financial/idempotency-critical paths.
- **Session transforms: own your namespace** — Each session app owns its output namespace; never write to another app's output namespace. Use `public.*` for input propagation only, not as a read model. Frontend reads private namespaces for business state.
- **Use VTEX design systems in admin apps** — Admin apps should use official VTEX design systems such as `vtex.styleguide` or `@vtex/shoreline`. Generic third-party UI libraries break consistency and are not supported.
- **Use css-handles for storefront styling** — Never hardcode class names. Use `useCssHandles()` to expose safe CSS classes for customization.
- **Master Data has a 60-schema-per-entity hard limit** — Plan your schema versioning strategy to avoid hitting this limit.
